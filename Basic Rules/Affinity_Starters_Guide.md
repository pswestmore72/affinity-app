## The One Rule You Must Understand

**There are NO hit points.** You have **Hit Dice**—actual individual dice that exist or get destroyed.

```
You have 5d10 body dice = five separate d10 dice
Take 2 damage, fail defense = lose 2 dice → now you have 3d10
You don't subtract points. You lose DICE.
```

---

## How to Roll

There are two types of rolls in Affinity: **Action Rolls** and **Defense Rolls**.

*It is recommended to have multiple d6s (at least two colors) plus a set of polyhedral dice (d4, d8, d10, d12, d20).*

### Action Rolls (d6 Dice Pools)

When you attack, cast spells, or use abilities, roll **d6s** and count successes.

**The threshold depends on the action's tier:**

| Action Tier | Success Threshold | What Counts |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Basic** | 2+ | 2, 3, 4, 5 = 1 success; 6 = 2 successes |
| **Advanced** | 3+ | 3, 4, 5 = 1 success; 6 = 2 successes |
| **Expert** | 4+ | 4, 5 = 1 success; 6 = 2 successes |
| **Legendary** | 5+ | 5 = 1 success; 6 = 2 successes |

**At Level 1, most actions are Basic (2+).** A roll of 6 always counts as 2 successes.

**Example:** Basic attack, roll 3d6, get 6, 3, 2 → That's 4 successes (2+1+1).

### Defense Rolls (Armor/Body Dice)

When you defend, roll **your actual armor or body dice** (d6, d8, d10, d12, etc.).

**Defense always uses the same threshold: 5+**

| You Roll | Result |
|----------|--------|
| **5+** | Success — die survives, 1 damage cancelled |
| **1-4** | Fail — that die is destroyed |

**Larger dice survive better:**
- d6: 33% chance (5-6)
- d8: 50% chance (5-8)
- d10: 60% chance (5-10)
- d12: 67% chance (5-12)

**Example:** You have 2d8 armor. Take 2 damage, roll both → 7, 3 → One survives (7 ≥ 5), one destroyed (3 < 5). You now have 1d8 armor.

---

## Action Resolution (The Core Loop)

Every action in Affinity follows this pattern:

1. **Declare what you're doing** (and its tier — usually Basic at L1)
2. **Roll your d6s** (Proficiency dice + any exertion)
3. **Count successes** (based on the action's threshold)
4. **Check requirements** (did you meet the required successes?)
5. **Apply effect**

### At Level 1

- **Proficiency = 1** (you roll 1d6 for most actions)
- **Most actions are Basic:** 2+ threshold, need 1 success
- **That's it.** Roll 1d6, get 2+ = you succeed.

---

## Exertion (Risk for Reward)

Want more dice? **Exert.** But there's risk.

- **Add extra d6s** to your roll (up to Proficiency per action)
- **If you roll a 1 on an exertion die:** Lose 1 HD from your pool

At Level 1 (Proficiency 1): You can exert 1 extra die per action.

**Example:**
- Base roll: 1d6 (Proficiency)
- Add exertion: +1d6
- Roll 2d6, get 6, 1 → 2 successes, but lose 1 HD!

---

## Your Turn in Combat

**Movement:** 10 yards (doesn't cost an action)

**Actions:** You get **2 actions** per turn
- Attack, use ability, defend, help an ally, etc.
- Most things at Level 1 are **Basic** actions (easy to do)

**Free Actions:** Drop something, say something brief

---

## Attacking

1. **Roll** Proficiency d6s (+ any exertion)
2. **Need:** 1 success at 2+ threshold (for Basic attacks)
3. **Extra successes:** +1 damage each (capped at Proficiency)

**At Level 1:** Roll 1-2d6. Get any 2+. Deal base weapon damage + bonus.

**Example:**
- Attacking with a sword (Base 1 HD damage, Basic tier = 2+ threshold)
- Roll 2d6 (Prof 1 + Exert 1), get 5, 3
- Both are 2+ → 2 successes → hit for 1 base + 1 bonus (capped at Prof 1) = 2 HD damage
- If you'd rolled 6, 4 → 3 successes (2+1) → still capped at 2 HD damage at Level 1

---

## Defending

When you take damage:

1. **Attacker declares damage** (e.g., "3 HD damage")
2. **You roll defense dice** from your outermost layer (armor first, then body)
3. **5+ = that die survives**, damage cancelled
4. **4- = that die is destroyed**, move to next die

### At Level 1

- **Defense Capacity = 1** (you get 1 defense roll per attack)
- Roll 1 defense layer die. If 5+, cancel 1 damage. If not, lose that die.
- Any remaining damage = auto-lose dice from your pool.

**Example:**
- Take 3 HD damage, Defense Capacity 1
- Roll 1d8 (armor) → 6 = success, cancel 1 damage, armor survives
- 2 HD remaining, no rolls left → auto-fail → lose 2 armor dice
- If armor runs out, start losing body HD

---

## Hit Dice Tracking

Your character sheet shows dice pools:

```
Body HD:   ⬡⬡⬡⬡⬡  (5d10 body dice)
Armor:    ⬡⬡       (2d8 armor dice)
```

When you lose dice, cross them off. When they're gone, they're gone.

**At 0 Body HD:** You're in trouble (see Resolve below).

---

## Resolve (Mental Fortitude)

**Everyone starts at Resolve 5.** It rarely drops at Level 1.

**When Resolve drops (rare at L1):**
- Taking massive damage in one round
- Using maximum exertion repeatedly
- Failing difficult actions

**Don't worry about Resolve yet.** Your GM will tell you when to check.

---

## Resting

**Rest (30 min - 8 hours, "threatened"):**
- Regain 1 HD (at Level 1)
- Regain 1 Resolve
- Max 2 per day

**Recover (6+ hours, safe place):**
- Regain ALL HD
- Regain ALL Resolve
- Restore armor

## What You DON'T Need to Know Yet

These exist in the full rules, but ignore them for Session 1:

- ❌ Expert/Legendary/Ultimate actions (require higher Proficiency)
- ❌ Complex Resolve death spiral (just know: 0 HD + 0 Resolve = death)
- ❌ Social Duels (your GM handles these)
- ❌ Travel mechanics (your GM handles these)
- ❌ Multi-target action scaling (just roll and see what happens)
- ❌ Affinity Dice (learn after you've played a session)

## You're Ready

That's everything you need. When in doubt:

1. **Tell the GM what you want to do**
2. **Roll your d6s**
3. **Count 5s and 6s**
4. **The GM tells you what happens**

*Welcome to Affinity. May your dice roll high.*
