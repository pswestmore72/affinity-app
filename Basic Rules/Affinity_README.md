## System Identity

**⚠️ CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: There Are NO Hit Points in Affinity**

**Hit Dice are INDIVIDUAL DICE, not summed totals.**

```
WRONG (D&D thinking):
"I have 7d10 Hit Dice = I roll 7d10 and get 48, so I have 48 HP"

CORRECT (Affinity):
"I have 7d10 Hit Dice = I have SEVEN INDIVIDUAL d10 DICE in my body pool"
"When I take 3 HD damage, I might lose 3 dice (7d10 → 4d10)"
"Dice are destroyed one at a time, not points deducted"
```

**Character Notation:**
```markdown
Hit Dice: 7d10 (1d10, 1d10, 1d10, 1d10, 1d10, 1d10, 1d10) ← 7 discrete dice
Armor: 3d8 (1d8, 1d8, 1d8) ← 3 discrete dice (outer layer)

Defense Pool: [Armor dice] → [Body dice]
              (destroyed first)  (destroyed after armor gone)
```

**Affinity** uses a unified d6 dice pool resolution system where:
- **All action rolls use d6 dice pools**
- **Rolling 5+ = 1 success**
- **Rolling 6 = 2 successes (Explosive)**
- **Rolling 1 on exertion dice = burn 1 HD** (lose a die from your pool)

**Hit Dice serve as:**
- **Your health** (discrete dice, not summed points)
- **Fuel for abilities** (exertion costs)
- **Defense capacity** (dice rolled to sustain against damage)
- **Core tension** (risk vs. reward)

**When defending:**
- You roll individual dice from your outermost layer (shield → armor → body)
- 5+ = that die survives
- 4- = that die is DESTROYED (removed from your pool)
- You lose DICE, not \"hit points\"

**See Core Mechanics for complete dice pool explanation.**
