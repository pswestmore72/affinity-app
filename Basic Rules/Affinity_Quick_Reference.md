# Quick Reference

## Core Resolution

**All dice are d6. All rolls are dice pools.**

### Success Rules

- **at or above threshold = 1 success**
- **6 = 2 successes** (Explosive)
- **1 = burn 1 HD** (only on exertion dice)

### Action Resolution

1. Declare action and exertion (from turn budget: max = your level)
2. Roll Proficiency + Exertion dice
3. Count successes (5=1, 6=2)
4. Check if required successes met
5. Apply effect (Base Impact + Extra Successes)
6. Burn HD for any 1s rolled on exertion dice
