# Quick Reference

## Core Resolution

**All dice are d6. All rolls are dice pools.**

### Success Rules

- **at or above threshold = 1 success**
- **6 = 2 successes** (Explosive)
- **1 = burn 1 HD** (only on exertion dice)

### Action Resolution

1. Declare action and exertion (from turn budget: max = your level)
2. Roll Proficiency + Exertion dice
3. Count successes (5=1, 6=2)
4. Check if required successes met
5. Apply effect (Base + Bonus, bonus capped at Prof)
6. Burn HD for any 1s rolled on exertion dice

## Universal Actions

### Rush
**Cost:** 1 Resolve (automatic, no roll)

**Cost:** 3 HD (automatic, no roll)  
**Effect:** Immediately gain 1 Resolve  
**Frequency:** Resets on Rest

Trade physical vitality for mental fortitude. Use one action, lose 3 HD (no check), gain 1 Resolve immediately. No dice roll, no risk—pure sacrifice. **Note:** Priests and Sovereigns have superior Resolve restoration through class abilities.

- Make Resolve check each round  
- **4-:** Lose 1 Resolve  
- **5:** Hold current Resolve  
- **6:** Gain 1 Resolve
- If healed above 0 HD: Stop checks, regain consciousness
- If you reach 0 Resolve while at 0 HD: **Death**

**Stabilize Action (Basic 2+):**

## The Eight Skills

**Skills are context domains—they don't grant dice themselves.**

| Skill | When This Domain Applies |
|-------|-------------------------|
| **Agility** | Precision movement, stealth, dexterous manipulation |
| **Awareness** | Sensing, insight, investigation |
| **Fortitude** | Physical resistance, holding out, resilience |
| **Wilderness** | Tracking, navigation, animals, foraging |
| **Influence** | Persuasion, deception, intimidation |
| **Lore** | History, arcana, religion, theory |
| **Medicine** | Healing, anatomy, diagnosis |
| **Craft** | Making, repairing, engineering |

**How They Work:**
- GM identifies which skill domain applies to a challenge
- Players with **class abilities, feats, or features** that apply to that domain gain bonus dice
- Bonus dice from abilities do NOT burn HD on 1s (like proficiency dice—they represent trained reliability)
- Any character can attempt any roll, but abilities give advantages in specific domains

**Example:** Ranger's "Nature's Treaty" grants +2d6 on Wilderness rolls. Scholar's "Arcane Study" feat grants +2d6 on Lore rolls.

**Resolution Modes:**
- **Contest Mode:** Combat, duels, social conflict (extra successes = more impact)
- **Threshold Mode:** Travel, crafting, investigation (extra successes = quality/speed)

## Action Tiers
*base impacts and outcomes need work, this may be over generalized but a good starting point*

| Tier | Threshold | Required | Base Impact | Examples |
|------|-----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Basic** | 2+ | 1 | 1 HD | All weapons, cantrips |
| **Advanced** | 3+ | 2 | 2 HD | Class abilities, spells |
| **Expert** | 4+ | 3 | 3 HD | Powerful techniques |
| **Legendary** | 5+ | 3 | 4 HD | Epic abilities |
| **Ultimate** | 6 only | 4 | 5 HD | Reality-warping |

---

## Combat Quick Reference

### Your Turn
- **Movement:** 10 yards base (doesn't cost an action; some classes/paths/abilities grant additional movement)
- **Actions:** Up to 2 standard actions (player characters; NPCs vary)
- **Exertion per Action:** Each action has independent Proficiency exertion pool
  - Max exertion per action = Proficiency
  - Max exertion per turn = Proficiency × 2 (if taking 2 actions)
  - Unused exertion does NOT carry between actions
- **Free Actions:** Drop item, speak briefly (GM discretion)

### Defense Rolls

**Defense Capacity = ½ Proficiency (rounded up, min 1 die)**

| Level | Prof | Defense Dice |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1-4 | 1-2 | 1 die |
| 5-8 | 3-4 | 2 dice |
| 9-10 | 5 | 3 dice |

**Layered Defense (outermost to innermost):**
1. Magical barriers (d12) → Roll d12 per layer
2. Armor temp HD (d6/d8/d10) → Roll armor die type
3. Permanent HD (d6/d8/d10) → Roll class HD type

**Defense Roll Rules:**
- Roll die type matching the layer being defended
- Each 5+ = sustain (cancels 1 damage)
- Each 4- = fails to sustain
- If damage > defense capacity: Auto-fail, cannot roll enough dice
- If any damage remains after roll: Layer depletes (lose all temp HD from that layer)
- Move remaining damage to next layer inward
- **No explosive dice on defense** (highest roll = 1 success only, regardless of die type)
- **No exertion, no Affinity Dice allowed**

**Success Rates by Die Type:**
- d6: 33% per die | d8: 38% per die | d10: 40% per die | d12: 50% per die

**Defend Action:** Gain +2d6 bonus defense dice until your next turn
