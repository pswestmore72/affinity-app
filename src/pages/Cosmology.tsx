      <div className="intro">
        <p>
          The world of <strong>Aeralon</strong> exists within a complex cosmology of planes, powers,
          and ancient custodians who maintain reality's structures.

      <section className="cosmology-section">
        <h2>The Custodial Powers</h2>
        <p>
          Ancient entities that maintain the fundamental laws and structures of reality. They are not gods
          in the traditional sense—they are <em>functions</em>, cosmic roles that must be filled.
        </p>

        <div className="power-card">
          <h3>The Concordant Halls</h3>
          <p><strong>Domain:</strong> Oaths, Purpose, Commitment</p>
          <p>
            Keepers of sworn purpose. The Halls do not judge what is sworn—only that commitment is real.
            Paladins, mercenaries, executioners—all walk the Halls equally if their purpose is true.
            Connected to <strong>Combatants</strong> and <strong>Priests</strong>.

        <div className="power-card">
          <h3>The Living Accord</h3>
          <p><strong>Domain:</strong> Nature, Balance, Life and Death Cycles</p>
          <p>
            Maintains the balance between growth and decay, predation and preservation. The Accord recognizes
            no difference between nurturing and culling—both are necessary for balance. Connected to <strong>Rangers</strong>.

        <div className="power-card">
          <h3>The Curator Arcanum</h3>
          <p><strong>Domain:</strong> Knowledge, Understanding, Patterns</p>
          <p>
            Keepers of knowledge and humility. The Curator teaches that knowledge without humility ends
            the world, but interpretation of this lesson varies. Connected to <strong>Scholars</strong> and <strong>Weavers</strong>.

        <div className="power-card">
          <h3>The Veiled Threshold</h3>
          <p><strong>Domain:</strong> Spirits, Death, The Between-Spaces</p>
          <p>
            Guardians of boundaries between life and death, material and spiritual. The Threshold maintains
            the membrane that separates worlds but allows passage for those who know the way. Connected to <strong>Shamans</strong>.

          <h3>The Black Reliquary</h3>
          <p><strong>Domain:</strong> Endings, Finality, Necessary Destruction</p>
          <p>
            Keepers of what must end. Not evil, but inevitable—the force that ensures nothing persists
            beyond its time. Every cycle must close. Every story must end.
