# Game Master's Guide

## Core Philosophy

This game is a **heroic risk-attrition system** prioritizing:

1. **Dice pool resolution (d6)** — No d20, clean success counting
2. **Exertion as risk** — Commitment costs health
3. **Hit Dice as universal resource** — Health, power, stamina all from one pool
4. **Tiered Success Thresholds** — Clear power ladder (2+/3+/4+/5+/6)
5. **Explosive 6s** — Each 6 = 2 successes, natural drama
6. **Resolve as encounter clock** — Fights end decisively

## Running Combat Encounters

### Encounter Balance

**Action Count Matters:** Encounters are more dangerous when enemies have similar action economy to the party. One large enemy should have multi-actions or reactive abilities to match party action volume.

**Boss Action Economy:**
- **Expert-tier boss:** Takes actions equal to **2 + half the number of players** (rounded down)
- **Legendary/Mythical boss:** Takes actions equal to **2 + number of players**
- These extra actions prevent focus-fire obliteration and create dynamic encounters

**HD Guidelines by Enemy Count:**

- **Solo Boss:** 150-200% of party HD + extra actions (see above)
- **Equal Number of Enemies:** 75-100% of party HD
- **Swarm (more enemies than PCs):** 50-75% of party HD

**Why This Works:**
- 40 HD in one enemy without extra actions = focus-fire death
- 40 HD split across 4 enemies = distributed threats matching party actions
- Solo bosses need extra actions to survive concentrated attacks

### Enemy Design Template

**[Enemy Name]** (Level X)  
- **HD Pool:** XdY
- **Proficiency:** Half level (round up)
- **Resolve:** Equal to Proficiency
- **Attack:** [Action Name]
  - Tier: Basic/Advanced/Expert/Legendary
  - Rolls: Xd6
  - Required: X successes
  - Base Impact: X HD [damage type]
- **Special Ability:** Unique mechanic
- **Tactics:** How they fight

## Awarding Progression

### Experience Philosophy
**Don't use XP.** Instead, level characters when they:
- Complete a major story arc
- Overcome a significant challenge
- Reach narrative milestones

Typical progression: **1 level every 3-5 sessions**.

### Affinity Dice Awards
Grant Affinity Dice (d6s) when players:
- Embody their chosen Virtue dramatically
- Solve problems creatively
- Roleplay compelling character moments
- Make tactical sacrifices for the party

**Suggested Award Rate:**
- **Maximum Affinity gained per session = Proficiency**
- This prevents stockpiling and keeps Affinity as dramatic power, not baseline power
- At Level 5 (Prof 3), players can gain up to 3 Affinity Dice per session
- Encourages meaningful virtue embodiment rather than constant availability

## Treasure & Rewards

### Abolish Currency Tracking

**Gold and currency have no place in this game's mechanics.** Tracking coins is tedium.

**Instead:**
- Players and GM work together narratively to handle mundane expenses
- "You get a room for the night" — no gold tracking
- "You buy a round at the tavern" — assumed affordable
- "The blacksmith repairs your armor" — handled through downtime, not coin
- "You need better gear" — found through adventure, not shopping

**Currency exists in-world** (merchants trade, kingdoms mint coins), but **it's not a mechanical system players track**.

**Focus on tangible item rewards instead** — see Magic Items below.

### Magic Items

**See [Items & Artifacts](TTRPG_Items.md) for complete equipment, potions, and magical treasures catalog.**

**Awarding Frequency Suggestion:**
- **Common magical items:** 1-2 per 2 levels (purchased or found)
- **Basic magical items:** 1 per 2-3 levels  
- **Advanced magical items:** 1 per 3-4 levels
- **Expert magical items:** 1 per campaign arc (levels 5-7)
- **Legendary items:** 1-2 per entire campaign (major quest rewards)
- **Ultimate artifacts:** 0-1 per campaign
- **Mythical artifacts:** Campaign centerpieces, 0-1 per campaign (require 6 only to use)

## Social Encounters

Social encounters use the same dice pool resolution as combat:
- **Roll:** Proficiency + Exertion (class abilities may grant bonus dice if relevant domain applies)
- **Target:** Resolve instead of HD
- **Minimum Resolve:** Characters with Resolve below 2 cannot participate in social encounters
- **Initiative Bonus:** Characters who roll initiative and are not surprised gain 1 Resolve (max 5)

**Resolve Recovery:**
- **Short Rest:** Recover 1 Resolve
- **Long Rest (protected/safe):** Restore all Resolve to maximum (5)
- This ensures players can recover from social/mental exhaustion

See **Social Duels** in Core Mechanics for complete rules.

## Adjusting Difficulty

### If Players Are Struggling
- Reduce enemy HD pools by 25%
- **Adjust Required Success Threshold** (Expert 4+ → Advanced 3+)
- Introduce helpful NPCs or environmental advantages
- Allow more short rests
- Give Affinity Dice more freely

### If Players Are Dominating
- Increase enemy HD pools by 50%
- **Adjust Required Success Threshold** (Advanced 3+ → Expert 4+)
- Add Lair/Environmental actions
- Limit rest opportunities
- Introduce consequences from previous victories

**Threshold Tuning:**
Moving an enemy's action from 3+ to 4+ threshold is often more impactful than adding 5 HD. Use threshold adjustment as your primary difficulty knob—it changes success probability dramatically while keeping HP pools manageable.

## GM Best Practices

### Let Players Fail Forward
If they fail a check, don't just say "nothing happens." Give them partial success with complications.

### Avoid Static Stalemates
If combat becomes a grind:
- Trigger environmental effects
- Have enemies flee or change tactics
- Introduce third parties

### Reward Creativity
If players attempt something clever that's not in the rules:
- Set a DC appropriate to the difficulty
- Let them try even if it's unconventional
- Reward success with narrative impact
