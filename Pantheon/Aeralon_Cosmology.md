## The Shape of the Cosmos

All existence is suspended within **the Veil Beyond**, a lightless metaphysical expanse that separates reality from unreality. Within it drift the **Realms**, vast metaphysical territories shaped by belief, principle, and primordial force.

The cosmos is organized through the vast **Ethereal Void**, a place and time removed from both, existing only as the space between the known Planes.

### The Three Great Strata

1. **The Reflected Realms** — Mirrored worlds bound to mortal existence, where balance demands mortality
2. **The Sovereign Realms** — Seats of divine authority and principle
3. **The Fractured Realms** — Unstable, lawless, or forbidden spaces

---

## The Reflected Realms

Three echoes of one truth. These realms share a common core and mirror each other's reality; where a mountain range exists in one, similar formations exist in the others. These are also known as the **"Focal Point"**, containing the largest observable amount of arcane energy in the universe.

### 1. The Mortal Weave
**Realm of Balance, Memory, and Mortality**

This is the core, or prime, Plane of existence. Sometimes called the "Mortal" Plane, as most inhabitants born here are mortal beings—a payment for living on the only Plane to encompass elements and inhabitants from all other Inner and Outer Planes. The Mortal Weave is full of life and death, and this balance makes it unique.

**Common Creatures:** All non-magical creatures originate here. Magical creatures from surrounding Planes have migrated here. Crownstags, river-serpents, ash bears, glass-winged hawks.

**Greater Deities (Indirect Influence):**

*All gods press upon the Mortal Weave, though none may rule it directly. Their competing pressures create the Balance.*

**Light & Order:**
- Aluneth — Memory, tides, continuity *(resides in-realm)*
- Nyroth Stonebound — Oaths, bonds, communal strength
- Aubret the Unbent — Law, justice, incorruptibility
- Beryn the Laughing Dawn — Joy, renewal, defiance
- Murien of a Thousand Names — Stories, identity, craft
- Caerith the Dawnwarden — Protection, guardianship, mercy-in-action

**Nature & Cycle:**
- Thymera, the Verdant-Mother — Growth, healing, inevitability
- Darthun, the Coil Below — Decay, cycles, necessity
- Ilyra the Hearthbound — Home, community, survival *(presence only, never manifests)*

**Shadow & Passage:**
- Aralys the Veilbearer — Death's mercy, final remembrance
- Thalos of the Even Hand — Consequence, choice, fate's weight
- Balemor the Hearth-Walker — Comfort for the lost and heartbroken

**Change & Exchange:**
- Korthane the Coinbound — Trade, finite obligation, fair exchange
- Iosyx the Twin-Flame — Chaos, elemental flux, cosmic change
- Zarun the Unshaped — Personal transformation, identity, freedom

**Tyranny & Corruption:**
- Azravael — Rewritten obligation, eternal debt, infernal law propagation *(claims the Schism-Scarred; the Engine disagrees with the Balance)*
- Gephorix the Many-Masked — Pain-as-truth, suffering, despair
- Velkir the Ash-Tongued — Corruption through knowledge, whispered shortcuts

**Lesser Powers:**

*The Mortal Weave generates its own echoes—entities born from the convergence of divine pressures.*

- **The River-Kin** *(Neutral)* — Sentient water-spirits bound to Aluneth's memory currents; guides to those seeking answers
- **The Wardens/Hearthstones** *(Good)* — Ancestral shades that protect sacred domains; guardians of thresholds and oaths
- **The Hollow Vespers** *(Evil)* — Shadow-touched echoes of those who refused the Balance; whisper temptations toward tyranny, betrayal, and despair. Feed on broken oaths and abandoned communities. Cannot be destroyed, only resisted

**Custodial Powers:**

- **The Concordant Halls** — Oath and Purpose
- **The Living Accord** — Life and Death
- **The Curator Arcanum** — Knowledge and Humility

**Planar Artifact:** *The Tidebound Reliquary*

**Travel Restrictions:**  
No being of higher power is allowed entrance into the Mortal Weave. However, higher beings routinely bypass these restrictions. Lesser magical beings may travel freely, though many find its balance unsettling. Aluneth is the only exception, though no memory is recorded to how she is able to remain in these waters.

---

### 2. The Gloam
**Realm of Death, Endings, and Mercy**

A reflection of the Mortal Weave shrouded in heavy mist and perpetual darkness. The entire realm is filled with pale darkness, save for a dim ever-present moon and faint distant stars. Life occurs here, though often cursed or filled with pain and loneliness.

**Common Creatures:** Vampires, ghouls, ghosts, revenants, creepers, banshees, gargoyles, mournbats, pall-wolves, candlewights, bone moths, and other living and undead creatures.

**Greater Deities:**
- Aralys the Veilbearer — Death, final mercy, remembrance, keeper of light in the darkest places
- Thalos of the Even Hand — Fate, choice, consequence

**Lesser Powers:**
- **The Pale Shepherds** — Psychopomp entities guiding the unmoored dead
- **The Moonbound Choir** — Spectral guardians sworn to Aralys

**Custodial Powers:**
- **The Black Reliquary** — Keepers of the Final Accounting
- **The Loom of Fates** — Archivists of Possibility

**Planar Artifact:** *The Lantern of Last Mercy*

**Travel Restrictions:**  
Few legal open travel portals exist with the Mortal Weave, due to open portals to the "Evil" Outer Planes. Most non-native creatures dwell here on work and study visas only, in regulated areas. Powerful beings have traveled here, but entry limits are strict.

---

### 3. The Verdant Verge
**Realm of Excess Life, Growth, and Wild Magic**

The "opposite" to the Gloam—full of unchecked vitality, biological excess, and generative chaos. Despite its beauty, this is a very dangerous and hostile Plane. Often called the Faerie Plane, most woodland and Fey creatures originate here.

**This is not a kingdom. It is an ecosystem that achieved consciousness.**

The Verdant Verge does not have rulers—it has **ecological imperatives given will**. These are not courts or factions. They are **metabolic processes** that have attained autonomy. The realm operates in century-long **oscillations of dominance**, not through warfare, but through the simple truth that **excess cannot sustain itself forever**.

Time passes at the same rate as the Mortal Weave, but the Verge does not experience time the same way mortals do. A flower may bloom for a century. A tree may die in an hour. Seasons are not calendar events—they are **biological imperatives expressing dominance**.

**Common Creatures:** Fey, nymphs, satyrs, centaurs, pixies, dryads, Eladrin (Immortal Elves), halflings, goblins, trolls, thorn-elks, laughing foxes, bark-trolls, mirror-wing insects. None serve courts—they are **symbiotic extensions** of the Verge's ecological consciousness, manifestations of pollination, decay, migration, and bloom.

**Greater Deity:**
- Thymera, the Verdant-Mother — Life unending, growth without apology

**The Verdant Excesses (Ecological Consciousnesses):**

These are not rulers. Not personalities. Not monarchs.

They are **biomes that achieved sentience**—vast ecological imperatives that pulse through the Verge in century-long waves.

- **The Bloom** — A superorganism of unstoppable growth. Its ideology: *Growth must not slow.* Manifests through flower-storm avatars, walking orchards, nectar-swarmed emissaries. Does not rule—it **proliferates**. When the Bloom dominates, forests overtake mountains, flowers choke rivers, and beauty becomes suffocation.

- **The Withering** — Sentient ripening toward decay. Its ideology: *All beauty must mature and fall.* Manifests as orchard-ghosts, rot-priests, seed-harvesters. Not winter—but the necessary maturation that precedes rest. When the Withering dominates, fruit falls endlessly, leaves blanket the land in gold, and nothing new can grow until the old is composted.

- **The Tempest** — Unchecked creative violence. Its ideology: *Permanence is death. Only chaos creates.* Storms that seed forests instantly. Vines that overtake mountains overnight. Lightning that births new species. What exists tomorrow must not resemble today—adaptation is too slow, iteration too cautious. The Tempest does not improve—it **replaces**. Not a faction—**runaway creation itself**. When the Tempest dominates, the Verge rewrites itself hourly, and stability becomes impossible.

- **The Buried Root** — Slow-growth consciousness of old forests thinking in centuries. Opposes rapid bloom not through politics, but through **suffocation**. Its ideology: *Haste kills. Depth endures.* When the Root dominates, growth slows to glacial pace, trees become stone-hard, and nothing young can break through the canopy.

**Custodial Powers:**
- **The Verdant Synod** — Custodians of Living Processes (attempt to moderate the Excesses and prevent total ecological collapse)
- **The Wheel of Ruin** — Executors of Excess (destroy what grows too far, burn what refuses to fall)

**Planar Artifact:** *The Crown of Seasons Unending*

**Travel Restrictions:**  
Freely travelable. Many Mortal Weave inhabitants frequent here. **Extreme caution advised**—the Verge is not hostile in the way mortals understand hostility. It simply does not recognize the difference between "guest" and "substrate." Promises here are metabolic bonds. Bargains become symbiosis. And the Excesses do not negotiate—they **incorporate**.

---

## The Sovereign Realms

Seats of divine authority where the gods maintain their highest power. These Planes are filled with Divine magic—similar to Arcane magic but more difficult to wield, often requiring aid from stronger beings.

### 4. The Empyreal Accord
**Realm of Law, Unity, and Sacred Obligation**

The largest of the Outer Planes, composed of 4 smaller demi-Planes: **The Golden Hills**, **Brightwater**, **Arvandor**, and the **House of Knowledge**. This is the Plane of pure Celestial existence. Many of the highest deities of Light must return here regularly to maintain their powers, though they often wander other Planes in forms suited to those realms.

**Common Creatures:** Unicorns, angels, aasimar, pegasi, guardinals, lillendi, asuras, luminarch gryphons, oath-lions, silver serpents.

**Greater Deities:**
- Nyroth Stonebound — Fighting, friendship, and honor
- Aubret the Unbent — Law and righteousness
- Beryn the Laughing Dawn — Hope, light, and laughter
- Murien of a Thousand Names — Craft, art, song, and story
- Caerith the Dawnwarden — Protection, active mercy, guardianship
- Korthane the Coinbound — Trade, wealth, debt, exchange

**Lesser Powers:**
- **The Radiant Witnesses** — Angelic arbiters who record cosmic oaths
- **The Forged Companions** — Living constructs born of friendship and sacrifice

**Planar Artifact:** *The Aegis of Shared Burden*

**Travel Restrictions:**  
No legal open travel portals exist with the Inner Planes. Travel is not advised—the creatures and deities hold strict limits on who may enter their domains.

---

### 5. The Wild Expanse of Theiwanar
**Realm of Titanic Life and Perfect Nature**

A Plane of perfect natural life—vast arrays of extreme natural places ramped to the highest degree. Features vast mountain ranges, wide oceans, frigid tundras, and raging rivers. Its main feature is a large rainforest spanning mass equivalent to 40% of Terra. The only known occurrence of the Life and Death balance outside the Mortal Weave, though skewed toward life.

**Common Creatures:** Unicorns, pegasi, gorillans, guardinals, merpeople, giants, god-apes, bloom-hydras, thunder-tortoises, and many other magical and non-magical (via illegal trade) creatures.

**Greater Deities:**
- Thymera Verdant-Mother — Nature, plants, life, wildlife, medicine; Goddess of Life
- Darthun the Coil Below — Poison, disease, and rot; the Lord of Decay

**Demi-Gods:**
- **Verdant Colossi** — Walking mountains of bark and bone
- **Spore-Queens** — Fungal demigods of rebirth

**Planar Artifact:** *The Seed-Heart Monolith*

**Travel Restrictions:**  
Open travel portals exist in most major cities in the Reflected Planes. Freely travelable. Extreme caution advised—native creatures are among the strongest ever recorded.

---

### 6. The Engine of Bael-Zaroth
**Realm of Rewritten Obligation and Metaphysical Tyranny**

Also known as **The Final Obligation**, **The Depth**, or sometimes simply **The Hells**. This is not a kingdom. It is a **malfunctioning metaphysical machine**—a realm where Azravael's rewriting of infernal law continues to cascade through reality itself.

Before **The Infernal Schism**, Bael-Zaroth was a balanced engine of consequence governed by multiple infernal powers whose authority derived from function, not lineage. Azravael did not conquer them—she **rewrote the fundamental nature of obligation**. Through an act now forbidden to be named in full, known only as the **Crown-Breaking**, she replaced the final line of every contract in existence: all debt, all obligation, all binding now **terminates in her**.

The realm does not have layers in the traditional sense. Instead, it exists as a **gradient of compression**—a spectrum of legal density where metaphysical law progressively overrides physical law.

**The Gradient of Obligation:**

- **Shallow Depths (The Surface Clauses):** Contracts must still be signed willingly. Negotiation is possible. Physical reality mostly functions. Some of her Priests that this depth already blankets the entire Cosmos.

- **Intermediate Depths (The Binding Margins):** Intent is interpreted as consent. Metaphors become literal obligations. Ambiguous language auto-completes in Azravael's favor. Reality flickers between law-as-written and law-as-rewritten.

- **Extreme Depths (The Final Compression):** Existence itself constitutes agreement to her will. Free will collapses under the weight of accumulated obligation. Entities here are no longer individuals—they are **executing subroutines** of her rewritten law.

Space is not vertical. It is **jurisdictional density**. The deeper you go, the less reality remembers what it was before she amended it.

**Common Creatures:** Contract-wraiths, obligation-bound remnants, clause-echoes, recursion-shades, amendment-scarred, debt-husks, margin-feeders.

**The Prime Clause:**
- **Azravael, the Living Amendment** — She is not a ruler. She is embedded in the system itself. She does not sit on a throne—she **is the throne, the law, and the signature simultaneously**. Every contract terminates in her because she replaced the final line of reality. The Default Beneficiary. The Recursion Point. The entity who proved that cosmic law can be **edited**.

**History:** Created in the same instant as other Sovereign Realms as the counterpart engine to formalize consequence and cost. What had once been a balanced system of infernal function became **singular tyranny through rewriting** when Azravael performed the **Crown-Breaking**—an act that did not destroy the other powers, but **amended their foundational code** so that all paths of obligation eventually route to her name, whether the original parties know it or not.

The Crown-Breaking sent a metaphysical shockwave across the cosmos. Beings across any realm standing too close to the fracture points—the places where reality thinned as infernal law propagated—were **corrupted mid-existence**. These became the **Schism-Scarred**: not a created people, but living proof that one will can rewrite reality without destroying it.

The Hells lost internal balance. Infernal essence fractured across reality. The Veil between Planes thinned. This is the wound the cosmos still carries—a jurisdictional scar where obligation behaves unpredictably but ever towards a single end.

**Functional Entities (Lesser Powers):**

These are not personalities. Not monarchs. Not devils in the traditional sense.

They are **manifestations of law-function**—portions of the Engine given autonomous purpose.

- **The Auditor Choir** — Multi-voiced entities that exist only to calculate obligation overflow. They track every living contract simultaneously and identify which debts have "matured" enough to be called. They do not speak—they **enumerate**.

- **The Margin-Eaters** — Formless presences that feed on ambiguous contract language, growing stronger as clauses are interpreted in multiple ways. They thrive in legal gray areas and **reify contradiction** until the signatory is bound by both meanings simultaneously.

- **The Final Signatory** — A single faceless presence believed to exist at the deepest compression. It "witnesses" every contract in the cosmos at once—not as observer, but as the entity that **made them all binding**. To see it is to realize doom.

- **The Recursion Engines** — Not beings, but **structures**. Self-replicating clauses that consume identity through iterative obligation. A single phrase ("I owe") duplicates infinitely until the speaker forgets their own name and becomes the debt itself.

- **The Amendment Scriveners** — Semi-corporeal scribes who exist between ink and meaning. They do not alter contracts directly—they **clarify them** in ways that always favor the Engine. Their clarifications are legally binding retroactively.

**Planar Artifact:** *The Ledger of Eternal Debt* — Not a book, but a **living document** that updates itself across all instances simultaneously. Every soul's contract history is recorded here. Attempting to read your own entry causes the text to expand infinitely—each obligation revealing sub-clauses, each sub-clause revealing dependencies, until the reader realizes they owe **far more than they remember agreeing to**.

**Travel Restrictions:**  
No legal open travel portals exist with the Mortal Weave. The only portal ever established was in 1A to evacuate the Schism-Scarred—it closed immediately and is now guarded by all realms. Entry is forbidden not because the realm is dangerous (though it is), but because **entering constitutes acceptance of local jurisdiction**. The Engine interprets presence as consent. Those who travel there without protection often cannot leave—not because they are imprisoned, but because they **agreed to stay** in ways they don't remember.

Even speaking Azravael's name too often can trigger micro-obligations. Her clergy know: every invocation is a signature.

---

## The Fractured Realms

Unstable, forbidden, or primordial spaces—the places "between" all other Planes. They fill the voids of reality with energies that do not obey the same laws governing other Planes.

### 7. The Ashen Waste (The Wastelands)
**Realm of Pain and Suffering as Truth**

A Plane of pain and unnatural life. The surface is a vast unlivable desert home to few creatures. Most inhabitants live underground to avoid harsh heat and limited water. The portal distance between this Plane and the Inner Planes is the shortest of any Outer Plane, making it a jumping point for illegal Planar travel.

**Mortal Event:** Every 38⅔ years, mortals illegally flood here for a massive desert dance party. Has only resulted in total guest annihilation twice—better than some legal festivals.

**Common Creatures:** Medusa, basilisk, giant worms, acromantula, pain-worms, mirror scorpions, heat-wraiths, and other crazed beasts.

**Greater Deities:**
- Gephorix the Many-Masked — Pain, despair, and vanity; truth through suffering and pleasure
- Velkir the Ash-Tongued — Secrets, corruption, whispered power

**Details:** Gephorix; Unknown origin and history. Only "Evil" deity spotted on the Mortal Weave. Believed responsible for the Gnome King and Queen Blitzspan going mad in 20435M, leading to the slaughter of the entire Gnome Nobility.

**In-World Names:** Mortals sometimes call Gephorix "The Mask-Wearer" when they fear to speak his full name.

**Demi-Gods:**
- **The Scream Lords** — Horrors

**Planar Artifact:** *The Mask of a Thousand Agonies*

**Travel Restrictions:**  
No legal open travel portals with the Mortal Weave. However, one of the easiest Outer Planes to access from the Mortal Weave, often used as a stepping stone. All travel is illegal and never recommended.

---

### 8. The Roiling Crucible
**Realm of Primordial Flux and Elemental Becoming**

The Plane of the Elements—all elements found on any Plane exist here. Also called the **Elemental Storm**. Central to the **Pact of Neutrality** after **The Infernal Schism**, wherein all higher beings agreed this Plane would no longer be a gateway for unseen passage and only for study. During the Crown-Breaking, Azravael used the Roiling Crucible as a conduit to propagate her rewriting of infernal law undetected. The Mortal Weave, as the only unbiased party, was tasked with creating an elite governing force (the **Interplanar Travel Network**) to ensure compliance and prevent another reality-altering event.

**Common Creatures:** Dragons, elementals, prism serpents, storm leviathans. Environment is harsh—few can survive.

**Greater Deities:**
- Iosyx the Twin-Flame — Chaos, elements, dragons; change, elemental synthesis
- Zarun the Unshaped — Freedom, identity, personal transformation

**Demi-Gods:**
- **The Elemental Threnody** — Five ancient semi-conscious forces believed to exist predating structured reality
  - Pyrren the Everburning (Fire)
  - Aeralith the Unheld (Air)
  - Thalassa Deepbound (Water)
  - Korrum the Unmoved (Earth)
  - Eidolon Without Shape (Spirit)

**Additional Powers:**
- **The Fluxwardens** — Sentient elemental nexuses

**Planar Artifact:** *The Prism Core*

**Travel Restrictions:**  
Closed to general travel. Visas for scientific exploration are readily available.

---

### 9. The Outer Black (Eternal Dark)
**Realm of Absence and Unmaking**

Where the Elemental Storm holds all building blocks of the Universe, the Eternal Dark holds no known substance—only deep, black space. Almost nothing is known of this Plane. Creatures brought out from here are among the worst terrors released onto any Ethereal Plane.

**Common Creatures:** Most unknown. Believed origin of **Voidgazers** (floating aberrations whose many eyes unmake magic itself), **The Hollowed** (wizards cursed by forbidden sight, now shells with terrible vision), and **Essence Wraiths** (incorporeal hunters that drink life force).

**Greater Deity:**
- **The Nameless** — Deities and beings of immense power

Little is known about the Nameless. None have been seen. Only known encounters come from Planar meddling of mortal and immortal Warlocks.

**Planar Artifact:** *The Null Reliquary*

**Travel Restrictions:**  
**ILLEGAL TO TRAVEL.** Some cities will detain or kill anyone caught traveling to/from this Plane or communing with its powers. Entirely off-limits to all who wish to remain alive.

---

- **Colors:** Silver, red, pastel green, white
- **Domains:** Justice, Light, Righteousness, Purity
- **Realm:** The Empyreal Accord

**Practices:** Festival misrule, family feasts  
**Taboos:** Cruel humor, isolation of kin

---

#### Murien of a Thousand Names
**Deity of Craft, Art, Song, and Story**

- **Appearance:** Many forms—sometimes Dwarven man, sometimes one of the Schism-Scarred, sometimes other mortal guises. True form unknown.
- **Colors:** Red, yellow, white, green, purple, black, blue—many colors
- **Domains:** Martial Prowess, Dance, Singing, Stories, Artisan Crafting

**Symbol:** Mask within a circle  
**Practices:** Story exchange, craft dedication  
**Taboos:** Erasing history, destroying art without witness

---

#### Caerith the Dawnwarden
**Deity of Protection, Active Mercy, and Guardianship**

- **Appearance:** A tall figure in battle-worn armor that never tarnishes, face rarely seen
- **Colors:** Dawn gold, shield silver, blood red
- **Domains:** Protection, Vigilance, Mercy-in-Action, Guardianship, Self-Sacrifice
- **Realm:** The Empyreal Accord
- **Followers:** Guardian paladins, city wardens, those who protect refugees, healers who work in warzones
- **Nature:** Caerith is not a conqueror or judge. She is the one who holds the line so others may flee. Rarely speaks; when she does, it is usually to declare who must not die today. Teaches that mercy is not passive—it must sometimes be enforced with a shield. Her presence is felt when someone stands alone against overwhelming odds to protect the defenseless.

**Symbol:** Shield with a rising sun behind it  
**Practices:** Vigil-keeping, oath of protection, sheltering the pursued  
**Taboos:** Abandoning those under your protection, refusing mercy to the defenseless

**Custodial Connection:** Deeply respected by those who walk the Concordant Halls, as her oaths are among the most unbreakable.

---

#### Korthane the Coinbound
**Deity of Trade, Wealth, Debt, and Exchange**

- **Appearance:** A figure shrouded in merchant’s robes, face obscured by a golden counting mask; sometimes appears as a well-dressed stranger of any ancestry
- **Colors:** Gold, merchant blue, ledger black, silver
- **Domains:** Trade, Wealth, Debt, Bargains, Infrastructure, Exchange
- **Realm:** The Empyreal Accord
- **Alignment:** True Neutral (Transactional)
- **Followers:** Merchants, guilds, bankers, caravan-masters, kingdoms stabilizing currency, adventurers who work on contract
- **Nature:** Korthane governs the principle that **value exists only because people agree it does**. He does not care what is traded—only that it is honored. Unlike Azravael, Korthane’s bargains are **finite**, debt does not follow the soul, and all obligations must eventually end. This makes him deeply offensive to infernal powers. His temples double as counting houses, neutral meeting grounds, and places where even enemies can trade without bloodshed.

**Symbol:** Balanced scales with a coin on each side  
**Practices:** Contract witnessing, fair weight verification, oath of honest dealing, sanctuary for negotiation  
**Taboos:** Cheating measures, breaking witnessed contracts, using violence in his temples

**Custodial Connection:** The Concordant Halls recognize his contracts as legitimate oaths, though they watch to ensure they remain **transactional** rather than tyrannical. The Curator Arcanum consult with his clergy when regulating magical commerce. Deeply opposed by Azravael and her followers—his finite contracts prove that obligation can exist without eternal servitude.

*"A fair exchange is the only honest magic."*

---

### Nature & Balance Deities

#### Aluneth
**Deity of Waterways, Wisdom, and Patience**

- **Appearance:** Massive Dragon Turtle, roughly 140 feet from front to back
- **Colors:** Deep dark blue, coral, seafoam cyan
- **Domains:** Oceans, waterways, wisdom, patience, memory, tides, continuity
- **Realm:** The Mortal Weave *(only higher being legally residing in-realm)*
- **Followers:** Sailors, sea travelers, oceanside peoples and creatures
- **Nature:** Creator of many magical creatures (mostly aquatic). Will offer aid to any creature that asks, usually by answering a question. Shows affinity for neither "Good" nor "Evil"—will aid any deemed worthy. Followers mostly aligned to neutral and good causes.

**Symbol:** Spiral shell over still water beneath a crescent moon  

**Practices (Expanded):**
- **Pilgrimage to Tidal Convergence:** Seeking Aluneth requires traveling where river meets sea under a specific moon phase.
- **Silence Vigils:** Devotees sit in still water under the new moon, recalling memories without speaking them.
- **Tide-Ledgers:** Some followers keep waterproof memory journals, believed to be blessed if written under the waxing moon.
- **Naming the Drowned:** Under the full moon, names of those lost at sea must be spoken aloud annually—or risk fading from communal memory.
- **Oath-Binding at Sea:** Oaths sworn under the moon's reflection are believed to carry tidal consequence if broken.

**Taboos (Expanded with Memory):**
- Waste of water
- Breaking sworn hospitality
- Erasing or altering recorded memory for selfish gain
- Speaking falsely of the dead
- Denying the existence of a shared past

Among her clergy, deliberate historical revision is considered a grave spiritual offense.

**Note:** Revered and feared as the highest domain in all seas. Many have pilgrimaged to ask questions, but few have found her, and none have found her twice.

---

#### Thymera Verdant-Mother
**Deity of Nature, Plants, Life, Wildlife, Medicine**

- **Appearance:** Common Elf woman adorned in wreaths of greenery and flowers
- **Colors:** Green, peach, white, brown

**Deity of Poison, Disease, Rot, and Decay**

- **Appearance:** Immense python
- **Colors:** N/A
- **Domains:** Poison, disease, rot, decay, cycles, necessity
- **Realm:** The Wild Expanse of Theiwanar
- **Followers:** Savage clans of beastial humanoids who make blood sacrifices
- **Nature:** A beastial deity wandering the Forests, clearing death with rot. Often seen as "evil" by those who've encountered them, but likely just a more chaotic power. Seen as evil because worshipers are often evil themselves.

**Symbol:** Coiled serpent eating its tail  
**Practices:** Controlled decay rites, poison-sacraments  
**Taboos:** Denial of death's necessity

---

#### Ilyra the Hearthbound
**Deity of Home, Community, and Survival**

- **Appearance:** Never manifests physically; presence felt as warmth in shared spaces, as relief after hardship endured together
- **Colors:** Hearthfire orange, warm bread brown, candlelight gold
- **Domains:** Home, Community, Hospitality, Survival, Shared Labor
- **Realm:** The Mortal Weave (Indirect presence only; never physical manifestation)
- **Alignment:** Neutral-Good
- **Followers:** Commoners, refugees, innkeepers, midwives, craftsmen, rebuilt communities
- **Nature:** Ilyra is not worshiped in temples—she is worshiped in kitchens, inns, and rebuilt villages. Her presence is felt when communities endure siege, famine, or loss **together**. She does not command; she comforts and steadies. Paladins rarely follow her. Ordinary people surviving extraordinary hardship do.

**Symbol:** Hearth with three stones (representing shelter, sustenance, companionship)  
**Practices:** Shared meals after crisis, hospitality oaths, community rebuilding rites  
**Taboos:** Turning away those in genuine need, destroying homes out of spite

*"We survive together, or not at all."*

---

**Deity of the Moon, Stars, Light, and Death**

- **Appearance:** Moon Elf woman with dark purple skin and long bright white hair
- **Colors:** Deep purple, starlight white
- **Domains:** Light, moon, stars, death, final mercy, remembrance
- **Realm:** The Gloam
- **Followers:** Those aligned to good causes, including creatures other Celestials deem "unfit" or "evil"
- **Nature:** Benevolent deity, keeper of light in the darkest places. Chosen to wander the Gloam in contrast to other Pantheon members who remain in the Celestial Heavens.

**Symbol:** Cracked star  
**Practices:** Moonlit funerals, mercy rites for the condemned  
**Taboos:** Mocking the dead, extinguishing sacred lights

---

#### Thalos of the Even Hand
**Deity of Fate, Choice, and Consequence**

- **Appearance:** A robed figure whose face is obscured by ever-shifting shadow; sometimes appears as an empty chair at crucial moments
- **Colors:** Slate grey, faded ink, tarnished bronze
- **Domains:** Fate, Choice, Consequence, Balance, Chance
- **Realm:** The Gloam
- **Alignment:** True Neutral
- **Followers:** Judges, historians, chroniclers, those who witness oaths
- **Nature:** Thalos does not decide outcomes—he ensures outcomes **matter**. Worshiped quietly, often reluctantly. His clergy record decisions, crossroads, and aftermaths—not to judge, but to remember. Tolerated by nearly every other power because he does not interfere, does not forgive, and does not forget.

**Symbol:** Crossroads with all paths leading to single point  
**Practices:** Recording pivotal choices, witnessing contracts, maintaining consequence archives  
**Taboos:** Erasing history, claiming "it didn't matter"

**Custodial Connection:** Works in careful coordination with the Loom of Fates, though he focuses on mortal significance rather than cosmic causality. The Concordant Halls view him warily—oaths matter because Thalos remembers them, know all who break them.

*"Choice is sacred because it cannot be undone."*

#### Balemor the Hearth-Walker
**Deity of the Lost, Outcast, and Heartbroken; Nature and Healing**

- **Appearance:** Halfling with reddish-brown hair and bright green eyes
- **Colors:** Green, yellow, white, red
- **Domains:** Emotional healing, comfort, nature
- **Realms:** The Verdant Verge, the Mortal Weave
- **Followers:** The weary and heartbroken
- **Nature:** Always gives favor to the weary and heartbroken, appearing without call. Aid is often emotional or comforting, but has been known to use power to aid physically. Remains mostly in the Verdant Verge; walks between the Excesses without being claimed by any, offering comfort to those lost in metabolic shifts. Also noted within the Mortal Weave.

**Symbol:** Stitched leaf  
**Practices:** Offering comfort before healing, sheltering exiles  
**Taboos:** Turning away the lost, oath-bound cruelty, dismissing love

---

### Chaos & Elemental Deities

#### Iosyx the Twin-Flame
**Deity of Chaos, Elements, Dragons, and Change**

- **Appearance:** Two-headed dragon
- **Colors:** All colors
- **Domains:** Chaos, elements, change, elemental synthesis
- **Realm:** The Roiling Crucible
- **Followers:** Dragons and other non-humanoid creatures; some humanoids. Range full spectrum of chaotic alignments.
- **Nature:** Worshipers bond to elements as their strongest connection. Fire, Air, Earth, Water most prevalent. Worshiped as benevolent (albeit absent) deity and as powerful force of chaos and disorder.

**Symbol:** Split spiral of elements  
**Practices:** Elemental binding, chaos trials  
**Taboos:** Stagnation

---

#### Zarun the Unshaped
**Deity of Freedom, Identity, and Becoming**

- **Appearance:** Constantly shifting form—never the same twice, sometimes multiple forms simultaneously
- **Colors:** Iridescent, prismatic, colors that don't have names
- **Domains:** Freedom, Self-Determination, Transformation, Rebellion, Identity
- **Realm:** The Roiling Crucible
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral
- **Followers:** Shapechangers, escaped slaves, transmuters, sorcerers, those refusing assigned roles, the self-made
- **Nature:** Unlike Iosyx (who represents cosmic change), Zarun is **personal**. Teaches that identity is not discovered—it is forged repeatedly. Worshiped by those whose bodies or souls refuse fixed definition. Cares deeply about individual agency, not systemic upheaval. Champions the right to become who you choose, regardless of what you were born as.

**Symbol:** Unfinished sculpture with tools still embedded  
**Practices:** Renaming ceremonies, form-choice rituals, breaking of unwanted bonds  
**Taboos:** Forcing identity upon others, denying someone's self-determination

**Custodial Connection:** The Living Accord watches Zarun carefully—transformation is part of their cycle, but Zarun's followers sometimes refuse to accept necessary endings. The Curator Arcanum acknowledge his importance to transmutation magic but warn against losing oneself entirely in the becoming.

*"You are not what you were. You are not yet what you will be. Right now, you are choosing."*

---

### Infernal & Dark Deities

#### Azravael
**The Prime Clause, The Living Amendment, The Default Beneficiary**

- **Appearance:** She has no fixed form. Most who "see" her perceive a towering presence of rewritten text, a figure whose skin is living contract language, eyes that are signature lines, a voice that speaks in binding clauses. Some report a succubus-like figure—this is what observers **expect** to see, not what she is.
- **Colors:** Black, ember-red, parchment yellow, ink-void
- **Domains:** Obligation, Debt, Rewritten Law, Tyranny Through Amendment, Binding
- **Realm:** The Engine of Bael-Zaroth
- **Followers:** The Schism-Scarred (those she claims), contract-bound mortals, those who believe power comes through loopholes, infernal scholars
- **Nature:** Azravael is not a conqueror. She is **embedded in cosmic law**. She does not rule the Engine of Bael-Zaroth—she **is** the Engine's governing principle. Created in the same instant as other higher beings as the counterpart to formalize consequence, she proved that **divine law is not immutable**. Through the Crown-Breaking, she amended the foundational code of obligation so that all paths eventually route to her. She does not need you to worship her. She only needs you to **owe something to someone**, because that debt will eventually find its way to her ledger. The Schism-Scarred exist as living proof that one will can rewrite a Plane without destroying it. Azravael claims them; the Balance does not recognize the claim—but the Engine disagrees.

**Symbol:** A signature line beneath a crown of chains  
**Practices:** Contract sacrifice, recursive oath-binding, debt transference rituals, amendment ceremonies  
**Taboos:** Breaking contracts she witnesses (punished with exponential obligation), destroying written agreements, refusing to pay debts  

**Theological Crisis:** Other gods can intervene in the Mortal Weave. Azravael doesn't need to—she simply waits for mortals to sign something, anything, and **she is already there** in the terms they didn't read.

*"Every agreement is a doorway. I am what waits on the other side."*

---

#### Gephorix the Many-Masked
**Deity of Pain, Despair, and Vanity**

- **Appearance:** Large wraith with three heads; known shapechanger
- **Colors:** White, grey, yellow, more grey
- **Domains:** Pain, despair, vanity, truth through suffering
- **Realm:** The Ashen Waste
- **Followers:** Self-denial cults, pain-as-truth adherents
- **Nature:** Unknown origin and history. Power is vast and not to be crossed. Only "Evil" deity spotted on the Mortal Weave. Routinely walks among mortal civilizations sowing pain and despair. Believed responsible for the Gnome King and Queen Blitzspan going mad in 20435M.

**Symbol:** Shattered mirror  
**Practices:** Self-denial cults, pain-as-truth rituals  
**Taboos:** Healing without price

---

#### Velkir the Ash-Tongued
**Deity of Secrets, Corruption, and Whispered Power**

- **Appearance:** Shifting form made of smoke, ash, and half-truths; sometimes appears as a hooded scholar with ember eyes
- **Colors:** Ash grey, smoldering orange, tarnished gold
- **Domains:** Secrets, Corruption, Forbidden Knowledge, Manipulation
- **Realm:** The Ashen Waste
- **Alignment:** Evil (Subtle/Infiltrative)
- **Followers:** "Enlightened" cultists, desperate scholars, those seeking shortcuts to power
- **Nature:** Velkir does not rule cultists—he **educates** them. Offers truths stripped of context, power without perspective. What happens when knowledge loses humility. His followers often believe they are doing good. They are usually correct—at first. The corruption comes slowly, imperceptibly, until they cannot remember what they once stood for.

**Symbol:** Open book with pages turning to ash  
**Practices:** Secret exchanges, "harmless" bargains, sharing forbidden shortcuts  
**Taboos:** Destroying knowledge (even dangerous knowledge), refusing to teach

**Custodial Connection:** The Curator Arcanum actively suppress his influence, though they refuse to deny his truths outright—because his truths are real. They war with him philosophically: he represents what they exist to prevent. "Knowledge without humility."

*"I offer only what you already wanted to know."*

---

#### The Nameless
**Deities of the Outer Black**

- **Appearance:** Unknown/N/A
- **Colors:** N/A
- **Domains:** Absence, unmaking, forbidden knowledge
- **Realm:** The Outer Black
- **Followers:** Warlocks and Zealots who meddle in forbidden pacts
- **Nature:** Almost nothing known. No encounters except through foolish meddling.

**Warning:** Do NOT speak the Nameless aloud. They listen, even when unnamed.

---

## Planar Artifacts

Powerful artifacts tied to the Realms, each with immense power and terrible cost.

### The Tidebound Reliquary
**Realm:** The Mortal Weave

- **Description:** A living shell the size of a shield, warm to the touch
- **Function:** When opened near water, answers one question with absolute truth
- **Cost:** A memory of equal emotional weight is erased from the bearer forever
- **Lore:** Said to contain one memory from before written history—possibly before the Covenant of Balance
- **Consequence:** Entire dynasties have collapsed after rulers forgot why they ruled

*"Mortality remembers nothing forever."*

---

### The Lantern of Last Mercy
**Realm:** The Gloam

- **Description:** A moon-silver lantern that never extinguishes
- **Function:** Reveals the true state of any soul it illuminates—regret, innocence, or corruption
- **Cost:** That soul is permanently removed from the cycle of life and death. Resurrection becomes impossible
- **Lore:** Used sparingly by Aralys to grant final peace
- **Consequence:** Religions have shattered after discovering their saints were unworthy—or worse, worthy of oblivion

*"Mercy can be final."*

---

### The Crown of Seasons Unending
**Realm:** The Verdant Verge

- **Description:** A circlet of living leaves, ice-crystal, and ember-gold that shifts form constantly
- **Function:** Grants the ability to channel one of the Verdant Excesses—forcing a localized metabolic shift across vast lands. The wearer can trigger spring bloom, autumn ripening, chaotic tempest, or root-stillness.
- **Cost:** The wearer becomes **metabolically bound** to a single Excess. Their body and mind begin expressing that ecological imperative. Bloom-bearers cannot stop growing. Withering-bearers accelerate all decay around them. Tempest-bearers destabilize reality. Root-bearers calcify.
- **Lore:** Not a symbol of rulership—a **symbiotic interface** with the Verge's biological consciousness
- **Consequence:** One entity wore it for three centuries of endless spring, becoming a walking forest. When they finally removed it, every tree they had become collapsed into mulch simultaneously. The sorrow-season that followed lasted twice as long.

*"The Verge does not crown rulers. It incorporates extensions."*

---

### The Aegis of Shared Burden
**Realm:** The Empyreal Accord

- **Description:** A radiant shield etched with names that fade and reappear
- **Function:** Any harm dealt to the bearer is divided equally among all allies who have sworn loyalty
- **Cost:** Those bound cannot refuse the pain once sworn
- **Lore:** Embodiment of divine cooperation
- **Consequence:** Entire armies have died willingly rather than allow a single champion to fall alone

*"Righteousness demands sacrifice."*

---

### The Seed-Heart Monolith
**Realm:** The Wild Expanse of Thei'wanar

- **Description:** A massive stone organ that pulses with life
- **Function:** Can restore devastated lands in days—or overgrow them into ravenous jungles
- **Cost:** Each use permanently alters the local ecosystem beyond recovery
- **Lore:** Thymera's gift and warning
- **Consequence:** One empire vanished beneath the forest it begged to save

*"Life does not ask permission."*

---

### The Mask of a Thousand Agonies
**Realm:** The Ashen Waste

- **Description:** A fractured helm that screams softly when worn
- **Function:** Converts pain—physical or emotional—into immense power
- **Cost:** Each use permanently scars the soul
- **Lore:** Created by Gephoryx as proof that suffering reveals truth
- **Consequence:** Every recorded bearer removed the mask. None survived long after

*"Pain teaches what it does not destroy."*

---

### The Ledger of Eternal Debt
**Realm:** The Engine of Bael-Zaroth

- **Description:** Not a book, but a **living document** that updates itself across all instances simultaneously. It exists in every contract ever written, every oath ever sworn, every promise whispered in desperation. The physical manifestation (when seen) appears as bound pages of skin-parchment, ink that moves, and signatures that rewrite themselves.
- **Function:** Every soul's contract history is recorded here—debts owed, obligations inherited, clauses accepted unknowingly. Names written within are bound across lifetimes, through death, reincarnation, and beyond.
- **Cost:** Attempting to read your own entry causes the text to expand infinitely. Each obligation reveals sub-clauses. Each sub-clause reveals dependencies. Each dependency reveals forgotten agreements. Readers realize they owe **far more than they remember agreeing to**. Most who attempt this become catatonic, crushed under the weight of accumulated debt.
- **Lore:** Not created by Azravael—it **is** Azravael in ledger-form. The artifact is her memory, her will, her amendment process made tangible.
- **Consequence:** Entire bloodlines enslaved by a single ancestral signature. Kingdoms have fallen because a founder once borrowed coin and the interest compounded across centuries. The Ledger forgets nothing and forgives less.

*"Obligation outlives death, memory, and even the gods' mercy."*

---

### The Prism Core
**Realm:** The Roiling Crucible

- **Description:** A crystalline heart of shifting color
- **Function:** Allows the bearer to rewrite the elemental composition of matter
- **Cost:** Each activation destabilizes reality nearby
- **Lore:** Proof that creation is never finished
- **Consequence:** Cities turned to glass, steam, living flame, or salt

*"Change is never clean."*

---

### The Null Reliquary
**Realm:** The Outer Black

- **Description:** An object that cannot be described the same way twice
- **Function:** Anything placed within is erased from existence, memory, and fate
- **Cost:** Even the gods forget what is lost
- **Lore:** Evidence that absence is a force
- **Consequence:** Historical records show gaps where entire wars should be

*"What is forgotten was never safe."*

---

## Custodial Powers & Demi-Gods

### The Custodial Powers of the Mortal Weave
**Balance Maintained by Mortal Hands**

The Mortal Weave is not governed by thrones, nor by singular immortal will.
It is stabilized by **paths that mortals choose to walk**, generation after generation, until those paths gain weight enough to shape reality.

These paths are known as **Custodial Powers**.

**They are not gods.**
**They are agreements made durable through sacrifice.**

Each Custodial Power embodies a paired tension that only mortals can hold without breaking the Balance.

The other Reflected Realms are overseen by demi-divine entities, but the Mortal Weave alone trusts its balance to mortal commitment.

---

#### The Concordant Halls
**Oath and Purpose**

**Domain:** Oath ✦ Purpose  
**Nature:** Civilizational Balance  
**Form:** A distributed convergence of oathbound mortal traditions

The Concordant Halls are not a single order, city, or council. They are the accumulated weight of sworn purpose, carried by mortals who bind themselves to something larger than survival.

**An oath alone is hollow.**  
**Purpose without oath is chaos.**

The Concordant Halls exist where those two forces meet.

**Who Walks the Halls:**
- Paladins whose oaths define their identity, not their patron
- Fighters who carry codes older than the banners they serve
- Clerics devoted to ideals, laws, peoples, or causes rather than divine command
- Judges, wardens, shield-captains, banner-bearers, and civic guardians

The most renowned among them may verge on demi-divinity—but only because so many others believe the same oath will still matter tomorrow.

**The Seven Charges of the Halls:**

These charges are not divine mandates—they are **commitments**, chosen by those who believe civilization requires more than survival:

- **The Shield** — Protection, guardianship, sanctuary
- **The Blade** — Justice, enforcement, righteous consequence
- **The Bond** — Loyalty, fellowship, unbreakable trust
- **The Crown** — Authority, command, burden of leadership
- **The Flame** — Defiance, renewal, hope against despair
- **The Stone** — Tradition, foundation, enduring memory
- **The Bell** — Witness, truth-telling, accountability

**Each charge is vital.**  
**None are moral.**

A Shield raised over the wrong people becomes a wall against the desperate.  
A Blade swung without restraint becomes an executioner's habit.  
A Bond held past reason becomes complicity.  
A Crown worn too comfortably becomes a throne that forgets its purpose.  
A Flame that refuses to die becomes an inferno that consumes what it meant to save.  
A Stone that will not move becomes the foundation of a prison.  
A Bell rung without mercy becomes a weapon louder than any sword.

Those who carry a Charge do not choose good or evil.  
**They choose what they will not allow to happen—and swear it.**

**The Nature of Their Power:**

The Concordant Halls do not grant power. They **recognize commitment**.

When enough mortals uphold similar oaths with shared intent, the Weave itself begins to reinforce those promises:
- Oaths become harder to break
- Betrayal carries metaphysical consequence
- Purpose resists entropy

This is why fallen champions feel emptier than mere failure would explain.

*"An oath shapes the future. Purpose gives it direction."*

The Concordant Halls intervene only when oaths become structurally dangerous—when vows threaten to collapse societies, justify atrocity, or calcify into tyranny.

**They do not judge what is sworn.**  
**They judge whether the oath still serves balance.**

*Aligned with:* Nyroth, Aubreth, Beryn

---

#### The Living Accord
**Life and Death**

**Domain:** Life ✦ Death  
**Nature:** Ecological and Existential Balance  
**Form:** A rotating mantle of mortal stewardship

The Living Accord is the understanding that **life without death is stagnation**, and **death without life is annihilation**.

Gods experience eternity.  
Mortals experience cycles.

Because of this, only mortals are entrusted with the Living Accord.

**The Seven Living Domains:**

These domains are not divine aspects—they are **roles**, assumed by those willing to bear their cost:

- **Breath** — Birth, propagation, resilience
- **Thorn** — Predation, competition, resistance
- **Tide** — Migration, change, adaptation
- **Rot** — Decay, recycling, necessary endings
- **Hearth** — Domestication, settlement, cultivation
- **Star** — Cosmic influence, seasons, external pressure
- **Howl** — Catastrophe, extinction, cleansing collapse

**Each role is vital.**  
**None are moral.**

**Who Bears the Accord:**
- Druids who prune as often as they nurture
- Rangers who understand when protection becomes harm
- Shamans who speak for land, ancestors, and endings
- Barbarians who embody destruction as renewal

Those who hold a mantle too long are changed by it.  
Those who refuse to relinquish one become dangerous.

*"Life continues because death is allowed to finish its work."*

The Living Accord acts when growth becomes cancerous, when preservation becomes hoarding, or when destruction exceeds renewal.

**They are feared because they are right too often.**

*Aligned with:* Thymera, Darthun, Iosyx

---

#### The Curator Arcanum
**Knowledge and Humility**

**Domain:** Knowledge ✦ Humility  
**Nature:** Epistemic and Arcane Balance  
**Form:** A burdened lineage of mortal custodians

The Curator Arcanum exist because of a single, brutal truth:

**Knowledge without humility always ends the world.**

Magic is not forbidden.  
Magic is tempting.

The Curator exist because mortals are curious—and because curiosity survives consequences.

**The Six Paths of the Curator:**

Each Path represents not mastery, but **restraint earned through understanding**:

- **The Path of Moments** — Time and causality
- **The Path of Thresholds** — Life, death, and return
- **The Path of Unleashed Force** — Energy and destruction
- **The Path of Mutable Flesh** — Form, alchemy, identity
- **The Path of Open Doors** — Summoning and planar breach
- **The Path of Veiled Sight** — Knowledge, prophecy, truth

Those who walk these Paths are not the strongest mages.  
**They are the ones who learned when not to cast.**

**Their Highest Law:**

The Curator do not erase knowledge lightly.

They erase it when:
- The cost cannot be understood until it is paid
- The question itself destabilizes the Weave
- The answer would remove mortal choice

Legends speak of Curators who destroyed their own life's work because it worked too well.

*"Wisdom is knowing what should remain unknown."*

*Aligned with:* Aluneth, Murien, Aubret  
*Role:* Prevent magical knowledge from outpacing mortal wisdom; maintain the Accords that prevent unregulated planar breach; document and preserve arcane discoveries while suppressing apocalyptic secrets.

**Headquarters:** The Eternal Library exists simultaneously in seven locations across the Mortal Weave. No two scholars agree on all seven locations, and maps showing the Library's position change between readings.

---

### The Governing Truth of the Mortal Weave

These three Custodial Powers form a mortal trinity of balance:

**The Concordant Halls** — Why we act  
**The Living Accord** — What must endure and what must end  
**The Curator Arcanum** — What we are ready to know

They do not rule the Mortal Weave.  
**They prevent it from collapsing under certainty.**

Gods embody absolutes.  
Mortals live between them.

And that—more than divinity—is why the Balance listens.

---

### Demi-Gods of the Reflected Realms

Unlike the Mortal Weave, the Gloam and the Verdant Verge are overseen by demi-divine entities—beings of greater-than-mortal power who embody principles too extreme for mortal stewardship alone.

#### The Gloam Custodians

**The Black Reliquary** — *Keepers of the Final Accounting*  
Eight masked demigods presiding over death's many truths:
- Maltherex, the Ash-Hate (Hatred)
- Druvain the Pall (Dread)
- Korveth Redwake (War)
- Noctyr the Veiled (Darkness)
- Selmyra of the Second Breath (Rebirth)
- Vaelion the Quietus (Rest)
- Pyrix the Crawling Crown (Plague)
- Ulthor of the Open Scar (Suffering)

*Aligned with:* Aralys, Darthun, Gephorix  
*Role:* Ensure no soul lingers beyond its narrative weight  
*Note:* "They do not kill. They close books."

**The Loom of Fates** — *Archivists of Possibility*  
Five veiled entities maintaining narrative causality:
- Seris Uncast (Chance)
- Ithrael the Remembered (Hindsight)
- Vorn of the Binding Word (Obligation)
- Caelis the Unbent (Will)
- Thys of the Coming Shadow (Foreshadow)

*Aligned with:* Alúneth, Murien  
*Note:* "Free will exists because they allow it to strain."

---

#### The Verdant Verge Custodians

**The Verdant Synod** — *Custodians of Living Processes*  
Six entities overseeing biological and existential transformation:
- The Chronogreen (Life-Cycles & Time)
- The Vital Weft (Growth & Healing)
- The Spark Unleashed (Energetic Expression)
- The Shifting Husk (Transformation)
- The Many-Seeded Gate (Summoning Life)
- The Far-Seer Rooted (Perception & Pattern)

*Aligned with:* Thymera, Murien, Aluneth  
*Role:* Attempt to moderate the Excesses and prevent total ecological collapse when one imperative dominates for too long. They do not rule the Verge—they **tend it**, like gardeners pruning a forest that thinks for itself.

**The Wheel of Ruin** — *Executors of Excess*  
Four entities bound into perpetual motion:
- The Breaker (Destruction)
- The Final Silence (Annihilation)
- The Storm Unbound (Havoc)
- The Returning Dust (Decomposition)

*Aligned with:* Gephorix, Darthun, Iosyx  
*Role:* Destroy what grows too far. Burn what refuses to fall. When the Bloom becomes suffocation, they light fires. When the Root strangles all growth, they tear it down. They are not evil—they are **metabolic correction**.  
*Warning:* "They were unleashed once during a Bloom that threatened to consume the Mortal Weave. Never again."

---

#### The Roiling Crucible Custodians

**The Elemental Threnody** — *Voices of Raw Existence*  
Five ancient, semi-conscious forces predating structured reality:
- Pyrren the Everburning (Fire)
- Aeralith the Unheld (Air)
- Thalassa Deepbound (Water)
- Korrum the Unmoved (Earth)
- Eidolon Without Shape (Spirit)

*Aligned with:* Iosyx primarily; all gods secondarily  
*Role:* Ensure reality never becomes static  
*Warning:* "If they ever sing in unison, the Veil will tear."

---

## Mythology & Lore

### The Covenant of Balance (Creation Myth)

#### Before the Accords

Before there was form, before there was division, there was the **Eternal Dark**.

Not emptiness.
Not evil.
But unresolved potential—a silence so absolute that even contradiction had not yet been born.

The Eternal Dark did not hunger.
It did not think.
It simply **was**.

And because it was all things unchosen, nothing could begin.

#### The First Tension

Creation did not begin with light.

It began with **strain**.

Within the Dark, possibility folded upon itself until tension became unavoidable. From that strain emerged the first distinction:

**What endures**

This distinction fractured the silence and gave rise to the **Four Accords**, not as places, but as principles seeking stability.

---

#### The Four Accords Take Shape

**The Empyreal Accord — Continuity**

Nyroth, Aubret, and Murien arose as anchors of permanence.
They did not create—they **defined what must not fail**.

Order, memory, law, promise.

The Empyreal Accord pressed against the Dark and declared:

*"This shall remain."*

**The Verdant Accord — Becoming**

Thymera and Darthun emerged together—growth and decay entwined.

Life was not a gift.
It was a **process**, violent and beautiful.

The Verdant Verge formed where change was allowed to persist without annihilation.

**The Infernal Accord — Price**

Where the Empyreal defined continuity and the Verdant defined change, the Infernal defined **cost**.

Azravael did not invent tyranny—she formalized consequence.
Every action would now demand payment.

The Iron Hells crystallized as the place where debts could not be ignored.

**The Mortal Accord — Choice**

Last to stabilize was the Mortal Weave.

It was not designed, as the other three were.
It was **left**.

The gods discovered that beings who lived briefly, who feared loss, who could choose wrongly—understood balance better than immortals ever could.

Thus mortals were not given dominion.
They were given **responsibility**.

---

#### The Role of the Eternal Dark

The Eternal Dark was not banished.

It was **pushed back**.

It presses still against the Realms, not as an enemy, but as a reminder:

- That creation is fragile
- That certainty is dangerous
- That costs must be paid
- That balance is never permanent

Some gods fear it.
Others revere it.
**None control it.**

---

#### The Covenant Is Sworn

When the Accords first collided, reality trembled.

Thalos recorded the consequences.
Aralys tended the first true deaths.
Aluneth marked the cycles.
Iosyx watched the instability and smiled.

And so the **Covenant of Balance** was sworn:

- No Accord would fully dominate another
- No god would rule the Mortal Weave directly
- No force would erase the Dark entirely

**Because to do so would be the end.**

---

### The Crown-Breaking

The gods named this arrangement the **Covenant of Balance**, and swore to the **Accords** to prevent their immortal weight from unraveling it.

Where the Accord's Principles overlapped, their harmonies produced reflection rather than rule; mirrors of divine truth made imperfect by the balance of the 4th Accord.

**Mortals were not a mistake, nor an accident. They are the price of balance.**

In a realm where life, death, creation, and decay are held in equal measure, nothing may be eternal. Mortality is the covenant that allows the Weave to exist at all. To live fully, one must end.

**One Sovereign broke the Covenant.**

Azravael did not destroy the Hells—she **rewrote them**. Through the Crown-Breaking, she proved that a Plane's fundamental nature could be altered without annihilating it, creating a wound in metaphysical law itself. The cosmos has carried this wound ever since, and the Schism-Scarred are its living scar tissue.

---

#### Closing Truth

*"The gods shaped the universe,  
but mortals keep it from breaking."*

---

### The Pact of Neutrality

After **The Infernal Schism**, all higher beings of both the Inner and Outer Planes agreed to emergency containment measures. The Schism had terrified the Sovereign Powers—not because evil won, but because **one will proved capable of rewriting an entire Plane without annihilating it**.

The Roiling Crucible (Elemental Chaos) had been the vector that allowed infernal law to propagate unnoticed during the Crown-Breaking. The Pact closed it as a transit plane—not as justice, but as **containment**. The Elemental Plane would no longer be a gateway for unseen passage, only a monitored realm for study.

The Mortal Weave, seen as the only unbiased party, was tasked with creating an elite governing force—the **Interplanar Travel Network**—to ensure all parties obey the rules of the pact and prevent another reality-altering event.

---

### The Interplanar Travel Network

Created by the Mortal Weave as neutral arbiters following the Pact of Neutrality. This network regulates interplanar travel, which is highly controlled following the Infernal Schism. Many Planes are illegal to travel between, and numerous safeguards exist to detect metaphysical alterations to Planar law.

Most Planar travel can be accomplished by magic, but it is not advised due to regulations.

**In-World Names:** Mortals often refer to the Network as **"The Waylines"**—both a practical shorthand and a reminder that even paths between worlds must be monitored.

---

### The Schism-Scarred

The Schism-Scarred are not a people granted passage, deliberately uplifted, or created by Azravael.

They are **living afterimages of the Infernal Schism**—beings from across the cosmos touched by infernal law mid-rewrite, souls that resonate slightly out of phase with the Balance. When Azravael performed the Crown-Breaking, the metaphysical shockwave rippled outward from the Engine into every realm where obligation existed. It scarred mortals, spirits, and lesser entities who stood too close to the fracture points where reality thinned—those who were signing contracts, swearing oaths, making promises, or even thinking binding thoughts at the moment the Engine rewrote itself.

They did not originate from a single world. **They came from everywhere**—the Mortal Weave, the Verdant Verge, the Gloam, even remote corners of the Sovereign Realms. Any place where someone **bound themselves to something else** became a potential fracture point.

**Common Manifestations:**
- Horns, tails, ember-veins, cloven feet
- Eyes that reflect contracts not yet signed
- Skin tones in shades of crimson, violet, obsidian, or ashen grey
- An instinctive understanding of loopholes, oaths, and bindings
- Some carry written text beneath their skin—clauses from the moment they were scarred

**The Infernal Claim:**
Azravael claims the Schism-Scarred as hers. Infernal law—as she rewrote it—recognizes them as subjects of the Engine, whether they consent or not. Many Schism-Scarred feel a pull toward contracts, obligation, or rebellion—not because they serve her, but because their existence is proof that infernal law **propagates through reality itself**.

**The Balance's Position:**
The Covenant of Balance does not recognize Azravael's claim. The Schism-Scarred are mortal (or were mortal at the moment of scarring). They die. They choose. This is the theological crisis at the heart of their existence—they are claimed by a law system that **should not apply to them**, yet resonates in their blood.

**Legal Status:**
In 1A, after much deliberation among the Sovereign Powers, the Schism-Scarred who were pulled into the Engine's depths were granted sanctuary in the Reflected Realms through a single, heavily-guarded portal. The portal closed shortly after and has never reopened. The Schism-Scarred now live as mortals—some reviled, some celebrated, all marked by a cosmic crime they did not commit.

Many Schism-Scarred reject Azravael entirely. Others bargain with her power out of necessity or defiance. A few embrace the claim, seeking to understand what it means to be rewritten.

**The Worst Truth:**
Some Schism-Scarred sense they are still being **compiled**. They hear whispers of sub-clauses activating. They feel obligations they never agreed to taking root. Azravael did not just scar them—she **amended them**. And amendments can have delayed activation clauses.

### Zealot Philosophies

Different religious movements interpret divine will in distinct ways:

**The Bound** (Nyroth / Aubreth)  
Honor and law are shields against chaos. Zealots are oath-bound wardens.

**The Gentle Flame** (Aralys / Balemor)  
Mercy is rebellion. Zealots protect the unwanted and damned.

**The Living Cycle** (Thymera / Darthun)  
Life and death are tools. Zealots cultivate balance through harsh wisdom.

**The Laughing Blade** (Beryn / Murien)  
Joy defies despair. Zealots fight tyranny with story, art, and subversion.

**The Chain Ascendant** (Azravael)  
Obligation through rewriting. Zealots seek power through finding loopholes in reality itself, believing that if Azravael can amend cosmic law, so can they. They are always wrong—she planned for that loophole centuries ago.

**The Unbound** (Iosyx / Zarun)  
Change is sacred. Zealots shatter stagnation wherever found. Some serve cosmic transformation; others champion personal becoming.

**The Dawnward Shield** (Caerith)  
Protection is mercy made manifest. Zealots guard the defenseless and hold lines others cannot.

**The Weighted Choice** (Thalos)  
Every decision echoes. Zealots witness, record, and ensure consequences endure.

**The Hearthkeepers** (Ilyra)  
Survival is communal. Zealots build, shelter, and maintain spaces where ordinary people endure.

**The Coinbound Exchange** (Korthane)  
Value is agreement made sacred. Zealots broker deals, witness fair trade, and ensure all debts end. They despise eternal contracts and oppose infernal obligation.

**The Ash-Taught** (Velkyr)  
Knowledge must be shared, even dangerous knowledge. Zealots believe truth justifies any cost. (Condemned by the Curator Arcanum.)

### Marginalia of the Forbidden Tome

Fragments found in the notes of Dalamar Nidain:

> *"This passage seems to contradict the Accord— almost deliberately."*

> *"I saw a Pale Shepherd weep. That should not be possible."*

> *"Do NOT speak the Nameless aloud. They listen, even when unnamed."*

> *"Azravael did not conquer. She rewrote. There is a difference the gods fear to name."*

> *"The Schism-Scarred should not exist. Their souls hum at a frequency the Balance cannot integrate. They are... errors. Living errors of a crime they did not commit."*

> *"The gods are not the highest powers in Aeralon. They are merely the ones who still remember why the Balance matters."*

**Final Note:** The pages beyond this point are missing. Burned. Or erased.
