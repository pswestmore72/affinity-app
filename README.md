# Affinity
## A Tabletop Roleplaying Game by Chandle Morbrook

*Where every die matters, every choice costs something, and the cosmos watches.*

---

**Affinity** is a d6 dice pool tabletop roleplaying game built on meaningful choice and resource tension. Hit Dice serve as both life and stamina. Exertion carries real risk. Magic draws from cosmic forces that may ask for more than you're willing to give. Whether you're dancing in a god's desert or delving into hollow temples, Affinity rewards players who commit fully—and sometimes, those who know when to stop.

### Core Design Philosophy
- **All dice are d6** — No searching for the right polyhedron. Just pools of six-sided dice.
- **Success Thresholds** — Generally, roll 5+ for 1 success, 6 counts as 2.
- **Hit Dice as Resource** — Your HD pool represents life, stamina, and capability. Spend it wisely.
- **Exertion Risk** — Bonus dice burn HD on 1s, creating tension in every meaningful roll.
- **Resolve** — Mental endurance that determines how much you can take before breaking.
