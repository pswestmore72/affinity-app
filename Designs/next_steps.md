Phase 1 — Freeze the Core System (1–2 weeks)

Your first job is to create a stable 1.0 release target.

Do NOT keep redesigning endlessly. Shipping matters more than perfecting.

1.1 Create Version 1.0 Definition

Create a file:

Affinity Core Rulebook v1.0 Scope.md


Define exactly what is included:

Core mechanic

All classes

Affinity system

Exertion system

Combat rules

Spellcasting

Equipment

GM rules

Basic enemies

Not included (yet):

Massive bestiary

Huge setting lore

Endless optional subsystems

You can add later as expansions.

1.2 Freeze Mechanics

Only allow changes that are:

Fixing contradictions

Fixing exploits

Improving clarity

Not:

Redesigning core structure

Adding entirely new subsystems

You are now stabilizing, not inventing.

Phase 2 — Convert Design Docs → Book Manuscript (2–4 weeks)

Right now you have system documentation.

You need a reader-facing rulebook.

These are different.

Create:

Affinity_Core_Rulebook_Manuscript.docx


Structure exactly as follows:

1 Introduction
2 Core Resolution
3 Exertion
4 Affinity
5 Character Creation
6 Classes
7 Combat
8 Magic
9 Equipment
10 GM Guide
11 Adversaries


Your goal is clarity, not completeness.

Phase 3 — Build Your Publisher Identity (1 day)

You need a publisher name.

Examples:

Affinity Games
Resonance Studio
Fracture Works
Exertion Press
Singularity Tabletop


Create:

Copyright page
Publisher name
Version number
Year


Example:

Affinity Core Rulebook
Version 1.0

© 2026 Affinity Games


This makes it real.

Phase 4 — Layout the Book (2–4 weeks)

Use Affinity Publisher.

Create:

Master pages
Paragraph styles
Symbols
Headers
Page numbers

Import manuscript.

Apply styles consistently.

Export test PDF.

This is where it becomes a real product.

Phase 5 — Cover Art Finalization (1 week)

You already have a strong direction.

Finalize:

Front cover
Spine
Back cover

Back cover needs:

Tagline
Short description
Publisher logo

Example:

Power is not learned.
It is revealed.

Affinity is a tabletop roleplaying game of identity,
exertion, and the forces that shape reality.

Phase 6 — Public Playtest Release (Optional but powerful)

Release:

Affinity Core Rules — Playtest Edition
Free PDF


On itch.io

This builds:

audience

feedback

credibility

Optional but highly recommended.

Phase 7 — Publish Commercial Release

Publish on:

Primary:
DriveThruRPG

Secondary:
itch.io

Upload:

PDF
Cover
Description
Preview pages

Set price:

$20 PDF

Enable print-on-demand.

This step takes less than 1 hour technically.

Phase 8 — Finish Your Web App Integration (Huge advantage)

Your affinity-app is extremely valuable.

Finish these features:

Character creator
Character sheet export
Rules reference

This dramatically increases adoption.

Most indie RPGs lack tools.

You already have a major competitive advantage.

Phase 9 — Create Starter Adventure (VERY high ROI)

Create:

Starter Adventure PDF


20–40 pages.

Includes:

Premade characters
Simple scenario
Few enemies

This helps people actually play.

Most systems fail here.

Phase 10 — Establish Online Presence (1–3 days)

Create:

Website landing page
Itch.io page
DriveThruRPG page

Optional but powerful:

Discord server

This builds community.

Phase 11 — Legal Protection (Simple)

You automatically own copyright.

Add copyright page.

Optional later:

Register copyright formally.

Not required immediately.

Phase 12 — Launch Strategy

Launch with:

Core Rulebook PDF
Print-on-demand option
Starter adventure

Post in:

r/rpg
r/indierpg
itch.io

You do not need massive marketing.

Phase 13 — Expansion Pipeline (Long-term revenue)

Future products:

Affinity Bestiary
Affinity Expanded Classes
Affinity Campaign Setting
Affinity GM Toolkit

Each becomes additional revenue.

Phase 14 — Engineering Infrastructure Priorities

Your GitHub project should evolve into:

/core-rules
/manuscript
/layout
/web-app
/assets
/art
/publisher


Treat Affinity like a software product.

Version it.

Release it.

Maintain it.

Phase 15 — Mental Shift Required

You must transition from:

System Designer → Publisher

This means prioritizing:

Completeness
Clarity
Presentation
Release discipline

Not endless redesign.

Phase 16 — Immediate Checklist (Do these next, in order)

This week:

Finalize rule scope
Convert docs → manuscript
Create publisher name
Start layout template

Next 2–4 weeks:

Finish layout
Finalize cover
Export PDF

Next 1–2 weeks:

Publish on DriveThruRPG and itch.io

You could realistically publish within 4–8 weeks.

The single most important truth

Affinity does not need more design to become publishable.

It needs packaging, presentation, and release.

You are closer than most indie designers ever get.
