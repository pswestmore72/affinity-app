# Affinity: Flux
## Card Game of Planar Warfare

*Power demands sacrifice. Every card is a choice.*

---

## What Is Flux?

**Affinity: Flux** is a competitive card game where you command forces from the Realms of Aeralon. Build a deck, spend Source to deploy units and cast spells, and destroy your opponent's Warlord to win.

The core rhythm: **Draw Source, spend Source, sacrifice for more.** Each turn brings new resources. What you draw determines what you can do.

And when you're desperate? **Burn your own units.** Roll the die. Hope it's enough.

---

## Components

- **Deck:** Up to 1000 points of cards + 1 Warlord
- **Source Cards:** 15 per player (any design you like)
- **One d6:** For Burn rolls
- **Life Tokens:** 5 per Warlord (different shape/color)

---

## Victory

**Destroy your opponent's Warlord.** When a Warlord reaches 0 Health, you lose.

---

## The Six Realms

Your deck is built from **one Realm**—where your forces originate. Your Warlord determines your Realm and deck identity.

| Realm | Identity |
|-------|----------|
| **The Weave** | Balanced, adaptable |
| **The Gloam** | Recursion, attrition |
| **The Verge** | Swarm, growth |
| **Empyreal Accord** | Protection, order |
| **The Engine** | Sacrifice, punishment |
| **The Crucible** | Burst damage, chaos |

---

## Source Cards

Source Cards are the fuel for everything you do. They represent the raw power drawn from Aeralon's planar energy.

### Setup

Each player contributes **15 Source Cards** to create the **Source Deck** (30 total).

Your Source Cards should be **visually distinct** from your opponent's—different card backs, sleeves, designs, whatever works. You need to tell them apart during play.

### Drawing Source

**At the start of YOUR turn**, draw **5 Source Cards** from the Source Deck. Place them **face-up in front of your board**—this is your Source Pool for the turn.

### Spending Source

| Source Type | Cost to Generate 1 Source |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Your cards** | 1 card = 1 Source |
| **Opponent's cards** | 2 cards = 1 Source |

To play a card costing 3 Source:
- Spend 3 of your Source Cards, OR
- Spend 6 of your opponent's Source Cards, OR
- Any combination (e.g., 2 yours + 2 theirs = 3 Source)

Spent Source Cards go to the **Source Discard**.

### The Draw Tension

You'll get a mix every turn. Some draws favor you. Some don't. **Adapt or sacrifice.**

### Replenishing the Source Deck

When the Source Deck runs out, immediately shuffle the Source Discard to form a new Source Deck.

### Turn End

At the end of your turn, discard **all** Source Cards (spent and unspent) from your pool to the Source Discard. You cannot hoard Source between turns.

---

## Life Tokens (The Warlord's Reserve)

Your Warlord begins with **5 Life Tokens** on their card. These represent their personal reserve—their vitality converted to power.

### Spending Life Tokens

Life Tokens are spent to activate **Warlord abilities** (see Warlords). They cannot be converted to Source.

This creates a separate resource track: Source fuels your cards, Life Tokens fuel your Warlord.

### Recovering Life Tokens

Some cards restore Life Tokens. When you recover one:
- Take a token from the supply
- Heal 1 Warlord Health

Life Tokens cap at 5. You cannot exceed your starting amount.

---

## The Burn (Core Mechanic)

When you're out of options, sacrifice your own forces.

**You may Burn once per turn** unless a card or ability grants additional Burns.

### How Burn Works

1. **Choose a unit you control**
2. **Remove it from the game** (not discard—gone forever)
3. **Roll 1d6** (treat 1 as 2, cap at 5)
4. **Draw that many Source Cards** from the Source Deck (or Discard if empty) into your pool

You may spend these immediately. They're yours regardless of whose design they are.

### Burn Results

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 1 | 2 Source |
| 2 | 2 Source |
| 3 | 3 Source |
| 4 | 4 Source |
| 5+ | 5 Source |

### Burn Modifiers

- **+1 to roll** if the unit cost 4+ Source
- **+2 to roll** if the unit cost 6+ Source

Modifiers are applied before the cap. A 4+ cost unit rolling a 4 = 5 Source (capped).

### The Permanent Cost

Burned units are **removed from the game**, not sent to discard. They cannot be retrieved by any effect. Your deck is literally dying for you to win.

This is the Affinity feel—power through sacrifice, fate determined by dice.

---

## Warlord Abilities

Each Warlord has:
- **A Passive** (always active)
- **An Ability** (costs Life Tokens to activate)

Abilities do not cost regular Source. They cost **Life Tokens only.** This creates tension: Save tokens for abilities? Or spend them for emergency Source?

### Affinity (Warlord Identity)

Your Warlord has an **Affinity** representing their philosophical alignment. This determines the *flavor* of their abilities but has no deck-building restrictions.

| Affinity | Ability Theme |
|----------|---------------|
| Memory | Retrieval, knowledge |
| Communion | Buffing, unity |
| Guardian | Protection, shields |
| Growth | Healing, strengthening |
| Decay | Destruction, weakening |
| Consequence | Triggers, reactions |
| Flux | Transformation, randomness |
| Freedom | Evasion, independence |
| Obligation | Forced choices, control |
| Suffering | Direct damage |

A Gloam Warlord with Decay might have abilities that destroy enemy units. A Weave Warlord with Memory might retrieve cards. Affinity is flavor, not restriction.

## Turn Structure

Players alternate turns. The game continues until a Warlord falls.

**Each Turn:**
1. **Draw 5 Source Cards** into your Source Pool
2. **Draw 1 card** from your deck (skip the very first turn of the game)
3. **Take actions** (any order, any number):
   - Play cards (spend Source)
   - Attack with units
   - Activate abilities (spend Life Tokens)
   - Burn units (roll for Source)
4. **Discard unspent Source** to Source Discard
5. **End turn** (discard cards to 7 if needed)

---

## Combat

1. **Declare attackers** and their targets (enemy units or Warlord)
2. **Defender assigns blockers** (one blocker per attacker max)
3. **Damage resolves simultaneously**
4. Units at 0 Health are destroyed → go to discard

**Notes:**
- Damage on units persists between rounds
- Warlord at 0 Health = game over
- Burned units bypass discard (removed from game)
