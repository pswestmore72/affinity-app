# Affinity: Flux
## Core Rules for Strategic Card Warfare

*Nothing endures. Everything becomes.*

---

## Introduction

**Affinity: Flux** is a deck-building card game set in the fractured cosmology of Aeralon. Players command armies led by powerful Leaders, drawing upon the primordial Source—the raw elemental energy that flows through the Roiling Crucible and permeates all reality.

When the Infernal Schism tore reality apart, the barriers between planes weakened. Now, Source energy bleeds freely between realms. Those who can channel it wield the power to reshape existence itself.

Build your deck. Draw your Source. Destroy your enemy's Leader.

---

## Game Overview

### Components

- **Deck** (up to 1000 points of cards + 1 Army Leader)
- **Source Tokens** (15 per player, placed in a shared bag)
- **Source Bag** (opaque bag for randomized draws)
- **Play Area** (battlefield, hand, discard, removed zones)

### Win Condition

**Destroy your opponent's Army Leader.** When a Leader is reduced to 0 Health, that player loses immediately.

### Player Count

| Players | Source Tokens | Tokens Drawn per Round |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| 2 | 30 total (15 each) | 21 |
| 3 | 45 total (15 each) | 29 |
| 4 | 60 total (15 each) | 37 |

**Team Play:** 2v2 is supported. Each team shares a Source pool but maintains separate decks and Leaders.

## The Ten Affinities

Source tokens are **not** Affinity-specific—any token can fuel any card. However, cards belong to one of **Ten Affinities** that define their philosophy and synergies.

### The Affinities

| Affinity | Philosophy | Playstyle |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Memory** | Preserving truth, honoring the past | Recursion, graveyard manipulation |
| **Communion** | Building community, offering shelter | Defensive synergies, healing |
| **Guardian** | Protecting the defenseless | Damage prevention, shields |
| **Growth** | Healing, nurturing potential | Ramping resources, strengthening |
| **Decay** | Accepting necessary endings | Sacrifice, removal, attrition |
| **Consequence** | Ensuring choices have weight | Triggers, reactions, punishment |
| **Flux** | Embracing change and chaos | Transformation, randomness |
| **Freedom** | Breaking bonds, self-determination | Evasion, untargettable effects |
| **Obligation** | Binding others to debts and terms | Control, forced actions |
| **Suffering** | Revealing truth through pain | Direct damage, life manipulation |

### Affinity Synergy

Cards work with any Source tokens, but **Affinity Synergy** provides bonuses:

- **Matching Leader:** Cards matching your Leader's Affinity cost 1 less Source
- **Affinity Pairs:** Some Affinities naturally synergize:
  - Memory + Decay (cycle of remembering and releasing)
  - Guardian + Communion (protecting community)
  - Growth + Consequence (actions bearing fruit)
  - Flux + Freedom (chaos enables liberation)
  - Obligation + Suffering (debts enforced through pain)

## Deck Building

### Construction Rules

| Component | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| **Army Leader** | Exactly 1 |
| **Total Points** | Up to 1000 |
| **Minimum Cards** | 40 (not counting Leader) |
| **Maximum Copies** | 4 of any single card |
| **Affinity Restriction** | None (mix freely) |

### Point Values

Cards have both a **Source Cost** (to play) and a **Point Value** (for deck building).

- **Point Value** reflects overall power and flexibility
- **Source Cost** reflects immediate resource demand
- High-value cards may have low costs (efficient) or high costs (powerful)

---

## Game Flow

### Setup

1. **Reveal Leaders:** Both players place their Army Leader face-up
2. **Shuffle Decks:** Shuffle your 40+ card deck
3. **Create Source Bag:** Each player adds 15 Source tokens to the shared bag. Shake to mix.
4. **Draw Opening Hand:** Each player draws 7 cards
5. **Mulligan:** Each player may shuffle their hand into their deck and draw 7 new cards (once only)
6. **Draw Source:** Draw 21 tokens from the bag (adjust for player count)
7. **Distribute Source:** Divide drawn tokens evenly between players; odd tokens go to a neutral pool
8. **Determine First Player:** Roll off; winner chooses to go first or second

### Round Structure

Each round consists of alternating **Turns** until all Source is spent or both players pass consecutively.

**Turn Order:**
1. **Draw Phase** (first turn of round only)
2. **Main Phase**
3. **Combat Phase**
4. **End Phase**

### Draw Phase

At the start of your first turn each round, draw 2 cards.

*(You do not draw on subsequent turns within the same round.)*

### Main Phase

During your Main Phase, you may (in any order, any number of times):

- **Play Unit cards** (pay Source cost, place on battlefield)
- **Cast Sorcery spells** (pay Source cost, resolve effect, discard)
- **Play Artifacts** (pay Source cost, place on battlefield)
- **Play Locations** (pay Source cost, replace any existing Location)
- **Activate abilities** (pay Source cost, resolve effect)
- **Pass priority** (let opponent act or respond)

### Combat Phase

Combat is declared against a specific target: enemy Units or the enemy Leader.

**Combat Sequence:**
1. **Declare Attackers:** Choose which of your Units will attack
2. **Declare Target:** Choose enemy Unit(s) or Leader as target
3. **Declare Blockers:** Defender assigns Units to block attackers
4. **Resolve Damage:** Simultaneously deal and receive damage
5. **Remove Destroyed Units:** Units at 0 Health are destroyed

**Combat Rules:**
- Units can attack the turn they enter play unless they have "Summoning Fatigue"
- Each Unit can attack once per round
- Unblocked attackers deal damage to their declared target
- Blocked attackers deal damage to blockers (and vice versa)

### End Phase

1. **Discard excess:** If you have more than 7 cards in hand, discard down to 7
2. **End-of-turn effects:** Resolve any "at end of turn" triggers
3. **Pass turn:** Your opponent begins their turn

### Round End

The round ends when:
- All Source tokens are spent, OR
- Both players pass consecutively with Source remaining

**Round Reset:**
1. Return all spent Source tokens to the bag
2. Shuffle the bag
3. Draw new Source tokens (21 for 2 players)
4. Redistribute evenly
5. Begin new round (non-starting player goes first)

---

## Source Economy

### Spending Source

Source tokens are spent to:
- **Play cards** (pay the card's Source cost)
- **Activate abilities** (pay the ability's Source cost)
- **Trigger certain effects** (as specified on cards)

### Source Pool

Drawn Source tokens are divided between players:
- **21 tokens ÷ 2 players = 10 each, 1 neutral**
- Neutral tokens can be claimed by paying 1 token from your pool
- Tokens spent go to a shared "spent" pile

### Affinity Discounts

- Cards matching your Leader's Affinity cost **1 less Source** (minimum 1)
- Some cards provide additional discounts for specific Affinities

### Source Manipulation

Some cards interact with the Source economy:
- **Source Drain:** Remove tokens from opponent's pool
- **Source Surge:** Add tokens to your pool from the spent pile
- **Source Disruption:** Force opponent to spend tokens inefficiently

## Zones

### Battlefield

Where Leaders, Units, Artifacts, and Locations exist during play.

### Hand

Cards you've drawn but not yet played. Maximum 7 at end of turn.

### Deck (Library)

Your face-down draw pile. When empty, you do not reshuffle—you simply cannot draw.

### Discard (Graveyard)

Face-up pile of cards that have been played, destroyed, or discarded.

### Removed (Exile)

Cards removed from the game entirely. Cannot be recovered by normal means.

---

## Combat Deep Dive

### Attacking the Leader

1. Declare an attacker targeting the enemy Leader
2. Opponent may assign blockers
3. If blocked: attacker fights blocker(s)
4. If unblocked: attacker deals damage to Leader
5. Reduce Leader health accordingly
6. At 0 health, Leader is destroyed—game over

### Multi-Unit Combat

- Multiple Units can attack simultaneously
- Each attacker must declare its target separately
- Defenders assign blockers per attacker
- One blocker can only block one attacker
- Multiple blockers can block the same attacker (damage is divided by attacker's choice)

### Damage and Destruction

- Damage is marked on Units (doesn't reset automatically)
- When Health reaches 0, the Unit is destroyed
- Destroyed Units go to the discard pile
- Death Rattle abilities trigger upon destruction
- Some effects heal damage; others remove damage counters

---

## Advanced Rules

### The Stack

When multiple effects trigger simultaneously or in response to each other:

1. Effects go on "the stack" in the order they were played/triggered
2. Each player may respond with Instant spells or abilities
3. When both players pass, resolve the stack in reverse order (last in, first out)

### Priority

- Active player has priority first
- After each action, priority passes to opponent
- When both players pass priority, the current phase/step ends

### Targeting

- Effects that say "target" require a valid target when played
- If all targets become invalid, the effect fizzles
- Effects that say "choose" are not targeting (bypasses Ward)

---

## Multiplayer Variants

### Free-for-All (3-4 Players)

- Each player has their own Leader
- Attack any opponent
- Last Leader standing wins
- Politics encouraged

### Two-Headed Giant (2v2)

- Teams share Source pool (still add 15 each)
- Teams draw Source together (37 tokens for 4 players)
- Each player controls their own Leader
- Team loses when both Leaders are destroyed
- Teammates may attack the same targets

---

## Quick Reference

### Round Structure

1. Draw Source → Divide evenly → First player starts
2. Turn: Draw Phase → Main Phase → Combat Phase → End Phase
3. Alternate turns until Source depleted or both pass
4. Return Source to bag → Shuffle → New round

### Source Costs

- Pay Source to play cards and activate abilities
- Leader's Affinity cards cost 1 less
- Maximum hand size: 7 cards

### Victory

- Destroy enemy Leader (reduce to 0 Health)
- If deck runs out, you continue with no draws
