# Affinity: Flux
## Quick Start Guide

*Learn in 5 minutes. Sacrifice everything.*

---

## Goal

Destroy your opponent's **Warlord**. When their Warlord reaches 0 Health, you win.

---

## Setup

1. **Warlords:** Place face-up, put 5 Life Tokens on each
2. **Decks:** Shuffle, draw 7 cards (mulligan once if wanted)
3. **Source Deck:** Each player adds 15 Source Cards (visually distinct), shuffle together
4. **First player:** Roll off

---

## Your Turn

1. **Draw 5 Source Cards** from the Source Deck (place face-up in front of you)
2. **Draw 1 card** from your deck (skip on game turn 1)
3. **Take actions** (any order):
   - Play cards (spend Source Cards)
   - Attack with units
   - Use Warlord ability (spend Life Tokens)
   - Burn units (roll for Source)
4. **Discard ALL Source Cards** from your pool to Source Discard
5. **End turn** (hand max: 7)

---

## Spending Source

| Source Type | Cost |
|-------------|------|
| Your Source Cards | 1 card = 1 Source |
| Opponent's Source Cards | 2 cards = 1 Source |

Life Tokens are for Warlord abilities only—not Source.

When the Source Deck empties, shuffle the discard to form a new deck.

---

## The Burn

When desperate, sacrifice your own units **(once per turn)**:

1. **Destroy one of your units** (removed from game—gone forever)
2. **Roll d6** (minimum 2, maximum 5)
3. **Draw that many Source Cards** (+1 if unit cost 4+, +2 if cost 6+)

This is the Affinity feel—power through sacrifice, fate determined by dice.

---

## Combat

1. Choose units to attack
2. Declare target (enemy units or Warlord)
3. Opponent assigns blockers
4. Damage resolves simultaneously
5. 0 Health = destroyed (to discard)

*Your Source is your options. Your dice are your life. What are you willing to sacrifice?*
