# Warlords
## Commanders for Affinity: Flux

*Your Warlord defines your Realm and your sacrifice.*

---

## What Warlords Do

- **Determine your Realm** (which cards you can use)
- Start with **5 Life Tokens** on their card
- Have a **Passive** (always active) and **Ability** (costs Life Tokens)
- **If destroyed, you lose**

Life Tokens fuel Warlord abilities only—they cannot be converted to Source.
