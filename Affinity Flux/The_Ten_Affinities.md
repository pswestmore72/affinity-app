## Building Multi-Affinity Decks

### Synergy Pairs

Some Affinities naturally complement each other:

| Pair | Synergy |
|------|---------|
| **Memory + Decay** | Kill things, bring them back, kill them again |
| **Guardian + Communion** | Protect the community, heal together |
| **Growth + Consequence** | Plant seeds, watch them ripple |
| **Flux + Freedom** | Chaos enables escape; escape enables chaos |
| **Obligation + Suffering** | Bind them in debt, make them pay in pain |

### Tension Pairs

Some Affinities oppose each other philosophically:

| Pair | Tension |
|------|---------|
| **Memory + Flux** | Preserve vs. Transform |
| **Guardian + Decay** | Protect vs. Destroy |
| **Growth + Suffering** | Nurture vs. Harm |
| **Freedom + Obligation** | Break chains vs. Forge them |
| **Communion + Consequence** | Forgiveness vs. Accounting |

**Tension pairs can still work mechanically**—the philosophical conflict creates interesting deckbuilding challenges and narrative tension.
