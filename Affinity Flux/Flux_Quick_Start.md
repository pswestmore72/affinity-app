# Affinity: Flux
## Quick Start Guide

*Learn in 10 minutes. Wage war forever.*

---

## The Goal

**Destroy your opponent's Army Leader.** Leaders start with Health (typically 20-30). Reduce it to 0 and you win.

---

## Setup (5 Minutes)

### What You Need
- Your deck (40+ cards + 1 Leader)
- 15 Source tokens each
- Opaque bag
- Play area

### Setup Steps

1. **Place Leaders:** Both players put their Army Leader face-up on the battlefield
2. **Add Source:** Put all 30 Source tokens in the bag (15 each)
3. **Shuffle:** Both players shuffle their decks
4. **Draw 7:** Each player draws 7 cards
5. **Mulligan:** Don't like your hand? Shuffle it back and draw 7 new cards (once only)
6. **Draw Source:** Pull 21 tokens from the bag
7. **Split Source:** 10 tokens each, 1 goes to neutral pile
8. **Roll Off:** Winner picks first or second

---

## The Round

Each round has the same pattern:

```
Draw Source → Play Turns → Source Empty → Reset → New Round
```

### Your Turn

1. **Draw** 2 cards (first turn of round only)
2. **Main Phase:** Play cards, activate abilities
3. **Combat:** Attack with your Units
4. **End:** Discard down to 7 cards if needed

### Spending Source

Everything costs Source:
- Playing a Unit card? Pay its Source cost
- Casting a Spell? Pay its Source cost  
- Using an ability? Pay its Source cost

**Affinity Bonus:** Cards matching your Leader's Affinity cost **1 less Source**.

---

## Playing Cards

### Units

Pay the cost → Place on battlefield → Ready to fight

```
Example: "Knight of the Accord" costs 3 Source
You have 5 Source → Pay 3 → Knight enters play → You have 2 Source left
```

### Spells

Pay the cost → Resolve effect → Card goes to discard

- **Sorcery:** Only on your turn, during Main Phase
- **Instant:** Any time, including opponent's turn

### Artifacts & Locations

Pay the cost → Place on battlefield → Provide ongoing effects

---

## Combat

### Attacking

1. **Choose attackers:** Which of your Units will attack?
2. **Choose target:** Enemy Unit or enemy Leader
3. **Opponent blocks:** They can assign their Units to block
4. **Deal damage:** Everyone fights simultaneously
5. **Remove dead:** Units at 0 Health go to discard

### Combat Math

```
Your Unit: Attack 3, Health 4
Their Unit: Attack 2, Health 3

→ You deal 3 damage to them (3 Health - 3 = 0, destroyed!)
→ They deal 2 damage to you (4 Health - 2 = 2 Health remaining)
```

### Hitting the Leader

If your attacker isn't blocked, it deals its Attack directly to the enemy Leader.

```
Your Unit: Attack 3, unblocked
Enemy Leader: 20 Health

→ Leader takes 3 damage → Now at 17 Health
```

## Winning

**Leader at 0 Health = Game Over**

That's it. Destroy their Leader before they destroy yours.

## Source Economy Quick Tips
