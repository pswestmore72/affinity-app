# The Six Realms
## Faction Guide for Affinity: Flux

*Each Realm shapes its inhabitants. Each inhabitant carries their Realm to war.*

---

## THE WEAVE
### The Mortal Realm

*Where all things meet. Where balance holds.*

**Identity:** Adaptable, resourceful, resilient

The Weave is the crossroads of existence—the only plane where all elements and all peoples coexist. Its inhabitants have no extraordinary gifts, only extraordinary stubbornness. They survive through community, cleverness, and sheer refusal to die.

## THE GLOAM
### Realm of Endings

*What did this mean?*

**Identity:** Inevitable, patient, returning

The Gloam is the weight of endings given geography. Its inhabitants are not evil—they are unresolved. Ghosts who haven't accepted death. Vampires who have. The Pale Shepherds who guide the lost. In the Gloam, nothing truly ends until it's ready.

## THE VERGE
### Realm of Excess Life

*Growth without limit. Beauty without mercy.*

**Identity:** Overwhelming, transforming, multiplying

The Verge is an ecosystem that achieved consciousness. Everything grows too fast, too wild, too strange. Its inhabitants are fey, dryads, and creatures of pure vitality—beautiful and utterly indifferent to anything that cannot keep up.

## EMPYREAL ACCORD
### Realm of Sacred Law

*Order. Unity. Obligation fulfilled.*

**Identity:** Protective, lawful, enduring

The Empyreal Accord is where celestial beings codify the laws of existence. Its inhabitants—angels, guardinals, oath-lions—do not fight for conquest. They fight because protection requires force. They will not break. They will not bend. They will hold.

## THE ENGINE
### Realm of Rewritten Obligation

*All debts terminate in her.*

**Identity:** Punishing, calculating, contractual

The Engine of Bael-Zaroth is not a kingdom—it's a malfunctioning metaphysical machine where all obligation routes to Azravael. Its inhabitants—devils, debt-collectors, clause-echoes—don't conquer through strength. They conquer through terms you didn't read carefully enough.

### Playstyle
- **Sacrifice your units for power** (Burn synergy)
- **Force opponent to make bad choices**
- **Punish enemy actions**

## THE CRUCIBLE
### Realm of Primordial Flux

*Where elements war eternally.*

**Identity:** Explosive, chaotic, powerful

The Roiling Crucible is where all elements exist in violent flux—fire and water, earth and air, lightning and void. Its inhabitants are elementals and dragons, beings of raw power who don't finesse. They hit hard and accept the consequences.

### Playstyle
- **High Power** aggressive units
- **Direct damage** spells
- **Random but explosive** effects
- Best for aggressive players who win fast or lose trying

## Deck Building

Your Warlord determines your Realm. **All cards in your deck must match your Warlord's Realm.**

This keeps decks thematic—a Verge army feels different from an Engine army. Choose your Realm, then build within it.

---

*Where does your Warlord march from? That determines everything.*
