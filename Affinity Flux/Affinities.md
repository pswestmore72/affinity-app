# Affinities in Flux
## Warlord Philosophy

*Every Warlord carries a philosophy. It shapes their power.*

## What Are Affinities?

Affinities are the **philosophical alignment** of your Warlord. They determine the theme and flavor of your Warlord's abilities—nothing more.

Unlike Realms (which define your cards), Affinities don't affect deck-building. They're simply a way to understand what your Warlord does and why.

## The Ten Affinities

| Affinity | Theme | Ability Style |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| **Memory** | The past endures | Retrieval, knowledge, recursion |
| **Communion** | Together we endure | Buffing allies, healing, unity |
| **Guardian** | Strength protects | Shields, damage prevention |
| **Growth** | Life finds a way | Stat increases, token generation |
| **Decay** | Endings enable beginnings | Destruction, weakening |
| **Consequence** | Actions have weight | Triggers, reactions, punishment |
| **Flux** | Change is constant | Transformation, randomness |
| **Freedom** | None may bind me | Evasion, protection from targeting |
| **Obligation** | Debts must be paid | Forced choices, control |
| **Suffering** | Truth through pain | Direct damage, life drain |

## Affinity by Realm

Each Realm tends toward certain Affinities, though exceptions exist:

| Realm | Common Affinities |
|-------|-------------------|
| The Weave | Memory, Communion |
| The Gloam | Decay, Consequence |
| The Verge | Growth, Flux |
| Empyreal Accord | Guardian, Communion |
| The Engine | Obligation, Suffering |
| The Crucible | Suffering, Flux |

*Realms define where you fight from. Affinities define why.*
