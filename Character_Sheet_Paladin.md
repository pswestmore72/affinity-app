### NOTES & BACKSTORY

**Background:**
Raised in coastal temple of Aluneth. Trained as archivist initially—recording tides, preserving ship logs, maintaining Tide-Ledgers of drowned sailors' names. During meditation at 17, Aluneth touched my mind directly: *"Memory unravels. Go forth. Be my anchor."* Have served as wandering memory-keeper since, recording forgotten histories and opposing erasure.

**Current Goals:**
- Investigate ancient temple of Khuldras (forgotten deity = my jurisdiction)
- Record truth of Stoneheart Clans' extinction
- Oppose any void/erasure forces encountered
- Ensure party members are remembered (journal entry for each daily)

**Bonds & Relationships:**
- **Aluneth** (patron) — distant but present, speaks in impressions/feelings
- **Auryx (Warlock)** — fellow divine servant, but SO DIFFERENT in approach (admiring)
- **Kael (Fighter)** — appreciates his steadfastness, literal anchor in chaos
- **Vex (Rogue)** — concerning lack of documentation, I'm fixing that ("You ARE real, I have notes!")

**Character Moments:**
- First dungeon: Found old burial site. Spent 3 hours recording every name on every tombstone. Party waited. No one complained.
- When Vex said "I don't matter": Pulled out journal. "I have 47 pages about you. You matter."
- Catchphrase: "I will remember this." (Can be comforting OR threatening depending on context)

---

### ADVANCEMENT PLANS

**Level 3 Goals:**
- Unlock **Divine Intervention** (call Aluneth for major memory preservation)
- Gain Feat improving Lore/memory preservation
- Add **Tidal Witness** path node (record combat details perfectly, replay later)

**Long-term Build:**
- Focus on memory preservation, Resolve anchoring, anti-void combat
- Eventually unlock **Mass Preservation** (protect multiple minds from erasure)
- Possibly multiclass into Scholar? (Knowledge + Divine magic = ultimate archivist)
- "If the cosmos forgets, I WILL NOT."

### TIDE-LEDGER EXCERPTS

**Entry 1:** *Met three companions today. Kael Ironwatch (Fighter, guardian-soul, steady). Vex Shadowmark (Sovereign, efficient, needs more self-worth). Auryx Brightscale (Priest, walking sunshine, Bahamut must be so confused). I will remember them all.*

**Entry 2:** *Stonebridge trembles. Mine broke into ancient temple. Khuldras—forgotten earth deity. This is my PURPOSE. The forgotten must be remembered.*

**Entry 3:** *Vex keeps saying they "don't matter." Unacceptable. Increasing documentation. Will prove their significance through sheer volume of evidence.*

---

*"Memory is the only immortality mortals can achieve. I will remember you. I promise."*
