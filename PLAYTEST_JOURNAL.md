# Affinity TTRPG Playtest Journal

**Purpose:** Document simulated playtests to validate core mechanics, stress-test edge cases, and identify balance issues before real-table sessions.

**System Status:** ALL Critical + ALL High Priority issues complete (Issues #1-12). System genuinely playtest-ready.

**Date Started:** February 16, 2026

---

## Playtest Goals

### Critical Mechanics to Validate

**Resource Conversion Loop:**
- [ ] Rush usage patterns (1 Resolve → Prof HD)
- [ ] Steady usage patterns (3 HD → 1 Resolve)
- [ ] HD ↔ Resolve bidirectional trade dynamics
- [ ] Death condition clarity (requires BOTH 0 HD AND 0 Resolve)
- [ ] Three death states: Collapse (0 Resolve, HD > 0), Dying (0 HD, Resolve > 0), Death (both 0)

**Combat Systems:**
- [ ] Multi-target action effectiveness (Area, Multi-Select, Sustained Zones)
- [ ] Proficiency scaling for area size and target count
- [ ] Defense rolls vs attack rolls balance
- [ ] Exertion burn (1s on exertion dice) creating tactical tension
- [ ] Resolve death spiral impact (cumulative penalties drive retreat/risk decisions)
- [ ] NPC action economy (simplified dice pools vs player complexity)

**Class Balance:**
- [ ] Combatants: HD pool (d10) + armor survivability vs Weavers (d6 fragile)
- [ ] Priests: Resolve restoration superiority (Power Word: Endure, Divine Conduit)
- [ ] Sovereigns: Resource efficiency mastery (Internal Alchemy, Resource Cascade)
- [ ] Weavers: Spellcasting power vs physical fragility
- [ ] Rangers: Wilderness domain bonuses impact
- [ ] Shamans: Spirit channeling and threshold manipulation
- [ ] Rogues: Precision damage and triggered actions

**Level 1 Fragility:**
- [ ] Starting HD (3 for all classes) survivability assessment
- [ ] Is Level 1 intentionally deadly or too brittle?
- [ ] Do players feel agency or helpless?

**Social Systems:**
- [ ] Social Duels targeting Resolve (debates, negotiations)
- [ ] Influence vs Lore vs Awareness approach viability
- [ ] Resolve damage in social combat vs physical combat

**Movement & Environment:**
- [ ] Chase mechanics (single contested roll resolution)
- [ ] Travel & Journey system (party cooperation, Hurdle complications)
- [ ] Movement actions (Dash, Forced March, Disengage)

**Edge Cases:**
- [ ] Held action penalty (Basic-only if unused) - too harsh?
- [ ] Maximum exertion per turn triggering Resolve checks
- [ ] Concentration breaking on failed Resolve checks
- [ ] Affinity Dice mechanical differentiation (currently just bonus exertion)

### Scenario 2: [PENDING]

*(Repeat structure for each scenario)*

---

## Mechanical Stress Tests

### Test 1: Resource Depletion Spiral

**Goal:** Validate Rush/Steady/Resolve death spiral interaction when party is pushed to breaking point.

**Setup:**
- Multi-round combat against sustained pressure
- Track each character's HD, Resolve, and action choices
- Identify when players choose retreat vs continue vs desperation

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Rush used when HD low but Resolve available
- Steady used when Resolve low but HD healthy
- Death spiral creates "you should be running" moment at Resolve 1
- No death unless BOTH resources hit 0

**Results:** [PENDING]

---

### Test 2: Multi-Target Proficiency Scaling

**Goal:** Validate area spells and multi-select abilities scale appropriately with Proficiency.

**Setup:**
- Test Fireball-like area spell at Prof 1 vs Prof 5
- Track area size increase (+5 yards per 2 extra successes, max Prof × 5)
- Test multi-select ability (Chain Lightning style) target count scaling
- Compare damage output vs single-target focus

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Prof 1 caster: Small areas, few targets (low-level feels appropriately limited)
- Prof 5 caster: Larger areas, more targets BUT not exponentially broken (cap prevents runaway scaling)
- Single-target attacks remain competitive (bonus damage cap at Prof prevents multi-target dominance)

**Results:** [PENDING]

---

### Test 3: Level 1 Survival

**Goal:** Assess whether 3 HD Level 1 start is appropriately challenging or too deadly.

**Setup:**
- Level 1 party (various classes) faces appropriate-tier threats
- Track: How many hits can Level 1 characters take before collapse?
- Track: Do players feel agency or helpless victims?
- Track: Does Resolve death spiral work at low levels or is it irrelevant?

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Level 1 is dangerous but manageable with smart play
- Or: Level 1 is too fragile, needs HD boost or warning in Character Creation

**Results:** [PENDING]

---

### Test 4: Priest & Sovereign Resolve Mastery

**Goal:** Validate that Priests and Sovereigns are demonstrably superior at Resolve management compared to baseline Steady action.

**Setup:**
- Party with Priest and Sovereign vs party without
- Track Resolve restoration: frequency, cost, effectiveness
- Compare baseline Steady (3 HD → 1 Resolve, uses action) vs class abilities

**Expected Outcomes:**
- **Priests:** Power Word: Endure restores BOTH HD + Resolve at range (vastly superior support)
- **Priests:** Divine Conduit restores Resolve WHILE dealing damage (offensive restoration)
- **Sovereigns:** Internal Alchemy HD→Will triggers automatically (no action cost)
- **Sovereigns:** Resource Cascade restores Resolve during successful attacks (combat-integrated)
- Both classes feel like Resolve specialists, not just "slightly better"

**Results:** [PENDING]

---

### Test 5: Social Combat Viability

**Goal:** Validate Social Duels as viable alternative to physical combat with distinct feel.

**Setup:**
- Negotiation, interrogation, or debate scenario
- Track: Does targeting Resolve feel different from targeting HD?
- Track: Are Influence/Lore/Awareness approaches balanced?
- Track: Do defensive options (Concede Point, Deflect, Walk Away) provide meaningful choices?

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Social combat feels mechanically distinct from physical combat
- Characters already wounded (low Resolve from combat) struggle in debates (resource interconnection works)
- Victory conditions (0 Resolve = concede, -1 Resolve = broken) create dramatic moments

**Results:** [PENDING]

---

### Test 6: Death & Dying Three States

**Goal:** Validate clarity of Collapse vs Dying vs Death mechanics.

**Setup:**
- Scenario forcing characters to each death state
- **State 1:** Character at 8 HD, 0 Resolve (Collapse - unconscious 0-2 days, NOT dying)
- **State 2:** Character at 0 HD, 3 Resolve (Dying - making Resolve checks each round)
- **State 3:** Character at 0 HD, 0 Resolve (Death - both resources failed)
- Track: Are states clearly understood? Any confusion?

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Collapse distinct from death (broken will, intact body)
- Dying creates tension (can rally on 6, death spiral on 4-)
- Death requires dual failure (reinforces "Resolve is critical stat" theme)
- Stabilize action (Basic 2+) provides meaningful ally intervention

**Results:** [PENDING]

## Pain Points & Unclear Rules

2. [Example: "Can you use Rush while at 0 HD and dying?"]
3.

**Table Slowdown Moments:**
1. [Example: "Calculating multi-target area expansion took 3 minutes"]
2.

**Unexpected Interactions:**
1. [Example: "Sovereign's Flawless Economy + no exertion burn created infinite resource loop"]
2.

## Missing Subsystems

**Identified During Playtest:**
- [ ] Environmental hazards rules (falling damage, drowning, poison, fire)
- [ ] Economy/treasure system (pricing, starting gold, treasure by level)
- [ ] Encumbrance/inventory (carrying capacity)
- [ ] Special movement (underwater combat, flying, mounted)
- [ ] Crafting/enchanting (if allowed)
- [ ] Multiclassing (mechanics or explicit "not allowed")
- [ ] Affinity Dice mechanical differentiation (each virtue unique benefit vs just bonus exertion)
- [ ] Held action penalty alternatives (feels too harsh, consider Basic/Advanced OR 1 action vs 2)
