## Understanding NPC Power Tiers

NPCs are categorized by their **Threat Tier**, which determines their overall power level and typical encounter difficulty:

| Tier | Description | Typical Level Equivalent | HD Range | Actions | Max Resolve |
|------|-------------|-------------------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Trivial** | Minimal threat, easily dispatched | Below Level 1 | 1-2 HD | 1 | 2 |
| **Basic** | Standard encounters for low-level parties | Level 1-2 | 3-5 HD | 1-2 | 2 |
| **Advanced** | Challenging foes for mid-level parties | Level 3-5 | 6-10 HD | 1-2 | 3 |
| **Expert** | Dangerous adversaries requiring tactics | Level 6-7 | 11-15 HD | 2 | 4 |
| **Legendary** | Epic threats, major story encounters | Level 8-9 | 16-20 HD | 2 + ½ party size (up) | 5+ |
| **Ultimate** | World-threatening entities | Level 10 | 21-25 HD | 2 + ½ party size (up) | 8+ |
| **Mythical** | Reality-warping cosmic forces | Beyond Level 10 | 26+ HD | 2 + party size (up) | 11+ |

**Note:** Higher-tier NPCs scale their action economy with party size to create epic, multi-phase encounters without becoming trivial or overwhelming.

---

## NPC Action Rules

**NPCs use simplified mechanics to reduce GM bookkeeping while maintaining the core dice pool system:**

### Fixed Dice Pools

**NPCs do NOT use exertion budgets.** Instead:
- Stat blocks show **total dice pools** for each action
- NPCs roll the listed dice pool every time (no exertion choices)
- **1s rolled by NPCs do NOT burn their HD** (no death spiral tracking)

**Example:**
```
Orc Raider (Proficiency 2)
- Greataxe Attack (Basic, 2+):
  - Rolls: 3d6 (always)
  - Required: 1
  - Base: 2 HD damage
```

The Orc always rolls 3d6 for this attack. No exertion decision, no HD burn from 1s.

---

### Reckless Aggression

Some NPCs can **temporarily increase their dice pools** under specific conditions:

**Reckless Trait Format:**
```
Special Abilities:
- Blood Rage: When below half HD, rolls 5d6 instead of 3d6 for Greataxe attacks
```

This represents desperate aggression without complex exertion tracking.

---

### NPC Actions Per Turn

NPCs get a different number of actions based on their Power Tier (see table above):

- **Trivial:** 1 action per turn
- **Basic-Advanced:** 1-2 actions per turn (GM's choice based on situation)
- **Expert:** 2 actions per turn
- **Legendary-Mythical:** 2+ actions (scales with party size for epic encounters)

**Why Variable Actions?**
- Solo bosses need more actions to challenge a full party
- Legendary+ threats feel like epic encounters, not just bigger HP bags
- Prevents action economy imbalance (4 PCs vs 1 boss)

**Action Tier Restrictions:**
- **All NPCs:** Only 1 action may be Expert tier or higher per turn
- **Legendary NPCs:** May use no more than 1 Legendary-tier action per round
- **Ultimate NPCs:** May use no more than 1 Ultimate-tier action per round
- **Mythical NPCs:** May use no more than 1 Mythical-tier action per round

These restrictions prevent NPCs from spamming their most powerful abilities and create dynamic, varied combat encounters.

**Triggered Actions & Held Actions:**
- NPCs can use triggered actions (reactions) if they haven't acted yet this round
- NPCs can hold actions, waiting for specific triggers
- If held action's trigger doesn't occur by round end, may only use for Basic tier actions

*See Game Master's Guide for complete NPC action economy rules.*

---

### NPC Resolve

NPCs have **variable Resolve** based on their tier:

- **Trivial-Basic:** Resolve 2 (easily demoralized)
- **Advanced:** Resolve 3 (moderate mental fortitude)
- **Expert:** Resolve 4 (disciplined)
- **Legendary:** Resolve 5+ (exceptional willpower)
- **Ultimate:** Resolve 8+ (supernatural conviction)
- **Mythical:** Resolve 11+ (reality-warping presence)

**Unlike player characters (who always have Resolve 5), NPCs scale to represent varying mental/spiritual strength.**

---

### NPC Defense Rolls

NPCs defend using the **same layered defense system as PCs:**

1. **Defense Capacity:** Proficiency
2. **Die Type:** Based on layer (magical barrier d12 → armor temp HD → permanent HD)
3. **No Exertion/Affinity:** NPCs cannot add bonus dice to defense
4. **1s on Defense:** Do NOT burn NPC HD (simplified bookkeeping)

**Example:**
```
Verdant Guardian (Proficiency 3, Armor 2d10 temp HD)
- Takes 4 HD damage from player attack
- Defense Capacity: Prof = 3 rolls
- Rolls: 3 separate 1d10 rolls (armor layer)
- Each success sustains 1 HD, each fail depletes 1 armor die
```

---

### Stat Block Dice Pool Explanation

When you see **"Rolls: 5d6"** in a stat block, this represents:
- The NPC's Proficiency dice (baseline competence)
- + Typical exertion (representing how aggressively they fight)
- = Fixed total (GM doesn't calculate each turn)

**The dice pool abstraction assumes NPCs fight at consistent aggression levels.** Proficiency dice and "exertion-equivalent" dice are combined into one simple roll.

---

### GM Tips for Running NPCs

**Keep It Simple:**
- Roll the dice shown in the stat block
- Don't track exertion budgets or HD burn from 1s
- Use "Reckless" traits for conditional power spikes

**Adjust Difficulty On-the-Fly:**
- If an NPC is too weak, describe them fighting more aggressively and add +1-2d6
- If too strong, describe exhaustion and reduce dice pool by 1-2d6
- Adjust HP mid-combat if needed (players never see your notes)

**Action Economy Tactics:**
- Legendary+ NPCs with multiple actions can split targets or perform combos
- Use extra actions narratively: "The dragon attacks, then breathes fire, then takes flight!"

**Resolve as Narrative Tool:**
- Low Resolve NPCs flee or surrender when bloodied
- High Resolve NPCs fight to the death or until objectives achieved
- Use Resolve damage from social encounters to demoralize enemies before combat

---

## NPC Stat Block Format

Each creature lists:
- **Threat Tier:** Power category (determines Actions and Max Resolve)
- **HD Pool:** Total Hit Dice (die type and count)
- **Proficiency:** Based on effective level
- **Resolve:** Mental/spiritual fortitude (varies by tier, see table above)
- **Armor:** Natural or worn armor (temp HD)
- **Movement:** Base movement speed
- **Attacks:** Name, tier, fixed dice pool, required successes, base damage
- **Special Abilities:** Unique powers or traits (including Reckless traits)
- **Tactics:** How they fight or behave
- **Terrain/Environment (optional):** Preferred terrain and how they use it tactically
- **Lore:** Connection to cosmology and narrative hooks

**Remember:** Dice pools shown are fixed totals (Proficiency + typical aggression). NPCs don't make exertion choices or burn HD from 1s—roll the dice shown and move on!

**Note:** Not all creatures have specific terrain preferences, but those that do gain significant tactical advantages in their native environments. Rangers, Priests, and environmental specialists should leverage or counter these advantages.

---

## Swarm & Group Mechanics

*For streamlining large fights and creating "bulkier" encounters without tracking individual creatures*

When running many identical creatures, use these optional rules to create **Swarms** (mindless or bestial mobs) or **Squads** (organized groups). This transforms multiple individual threats into a single, easier-to-manage entity.

### Creating a Swarm/Squad

Take any creature and apply the following template:

**Step 1: Combine HD**
- 2-4 creatures = ×2 HD (Small group)
- 5-8 creatures = ×3 HD (Medium swarm/squad)
- 9-16 creatures = ×4 HD (Large swarm/squad)
- 17+ creatures = ×5 HD (Horde)

**Step 2: Modify Attacks**
- Swarm attacks target all creatures in a 10-yard area (for Small) to 20-yard area (for Horde)
- Add +1d6 to attack rolls per size category above "individual"
- Base damage applies to each target in area (single roll, multiple victims)

**Step 3: Apply Swarm Traits**
- **Swarm Form:** Resistant to single-target attacks (+2d6 defense); Vulnerable to area effects (-2d6 defense)
- **Fill the Gaps:** Cannot be flanked; ignores difficult terrain (flows around it)
- **Overwhelming:** When swarm attacks, defenders lose 1d6 from defense roll per size category (too many attacks to block)

### Swarm HP Thresholds

As swarms take damage, they diminish:

| HD Remaining | Status | Effect |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| 75%+ | Full Strength | Normal attacks and abilities |
| 50-74% | Bloodied | Attack rolls reduced by 1d6 |
| 25-49% | Scattered | Attack rolls reduced by 2d6, loses Overwhelming |
| Below 25% | Broken | Must flee or make Resolve check to continue |

### Squad Mechanics (Organized Groups)

For intelligent creatures fighting in formation (soldiers, cultists, skilled bandits):

**Formation Benefits:**
- **Shield Wall:** Adjacent members grant +1d6 defense to each other (max +3d6)
- **Coordinated Strike:** Once per round, sacrifice one member's action to grant another +2d6 on attack
- **Focused Fire:** All squad members can target single enemy; if 2+ hit, add +1 HD damage per additional hit

**Leadership:**
- Every 5 creatures needs 1 leader (use next tier up stat block)
- If leader dies, Squad must make Resolve check or break formation (lose all Formation Benefits until they rally)
- Rallying requires leader action or successful Resolve check by any member

### Example Swarm: Goblin Horde

Take **Goblin Raider** (Basic tier, 3d8 HD) and create 12-creature horde:

- **HD Pool:** 3d8 × 4 = 12d8 (Large swarm)
- **Attack:** Crude Weapons (Basic, 2+), Rolls 5d6 (+2d6 for Large), Required 1, Base 2 HD to all in 15-yard area
- **Defense:** +2d6 vs single-target; -2d6 vs area effects
- **Special:** Overwhelming (targets lose 2d6 from defense)
- **Thresholds:** Full at 9+ HD, Bloodied at 6-8, Scattered at 3-5, Broken below 3

### Example Squad: Mercenary Company

Take **Sellsword** (Basic tier, 4d8 HD) and create 6-member squad with sergeant:

- **HD Pool:** 4d8 × 3 = 12d8 (Medium squad)
- **Sergeant:** Uses Veteran Sellsword stat block (Advanced tier)
- **Formation:** Shield Wall (+3d6 defense when adjacent), Focused Fire active
- **If Sergeant dies:** Resolve check or lose formations; -2d6 to all rolls until rally

### When to Use Swarm/Squad Rules

**Use Swarms for:**
- Mindless creatures (zombies, insects, slimes)
- Bestial packs (wolves, rats, bats)
- Situations where individual tactics don't matter

**Use Squads for:**
- Trained soldiers and guards
- Organized bandits or cultists
- Any intelligent group fighting together

**Use Individual Stat Blocks for:**
- Creatures with unique abilities that would be lost
- Boss encounters
- Narrative moments where each enemy matters
- Mixed groups (different creature types together)

## Trivial Tier Creatures

*Minimal threats, easily overcome by even level 1 characters*

---

### Mist Wisp
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 1d4  
**Proficiency:** 0 (rolls 1d6 on all actions)  
**Resolve:** 1  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** Fly 15 yards (hover)  

**Chilling Touch** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 1d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD cold damage (touch range)

**Special Abilities:**
- **Incorporeal:** Physical weapons pass through unless magical or blessed
- **Light Sensitivity:** Takes +1 HD damage from radiant sources

**Tactics:** Drifts aimlessly, only attacking when disturbed. Flees after taking any damage.

**Terrain/Environment:** Most common near Threshold Zones where the Gloam bleeds through, or in areas where the Hollow Mourning State has left its mark. Abandoned villages, forgotten battlefields, places where even grief has faded to nothing.

**Lore:** Fragments of memory from the Gloam that have seeped through planar boundaries, born during Hollow-tides when mourning forgets what it mourned. They seek warmth and life, draining it instinctively—not from malice, but from a desperate, wordless need to remember what being alive felt like. Associated with souls who slipped past the Pale Shepherds during the Hollow. The Moonbound Choir considers them cautionary tales: this is what happens when grief is never resolved. A Mist Wisp cannot be reasoned with because there is nothing left inside to reason with.

---

### Scrap Imp
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 2d4  
**Proficiency:** 0  
**Resolve:** 1  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** 10 yards, climb 10 yards  

**Bite** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 1d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD piercing damage

**Special Abilities:**
- **Scavenger:** Can consume metal objects (coins, nails, etc.) to restore 1 HD
- **Cowardly:** Flees if reduced below half HD

**Tactics:** Sneaks into camps to steal metal objects. Bites if cornered but runs immediately after.

**Lore:** Minor construct-spirits born from discarded metal and the Curator Arcanum's overflow of knowledge. Not malicious, just hungry and mischievous. Common in cities and workshops.

---

### Candlewight
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 1d6  
**Proficiency:** 1  
**Resolve:** 1  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** Fly 10 yards (hover)  

**Searing Touch** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 1d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD fire damage

**Special Abilities:**
- **Living Flame:** Sheds light 10 yards, can ignite flammable objects
- **Snuff:** Dies immediately if exposed to strong wind or water

**Tactics:** Hovers near travelers, drawn to loneliness and sorrow. Not inherently hostile but burns if touched. Follows grieving travelers for miles, offering light without words.

**Terrain/Environment:** Appears during Remembrance Mourning States, near deathbeds, and in places where someone died alone but remembered. Most common at crossroads and inn hearths after midnight. Occasionally drifts through the Mortal Weave where the Gloam's influence thins.

**Lore:** Spirits from the Gloam born during Remembrance—the Mourning State when grief still honors what was lost. Each Candlewight is the last flicker of hope from a dying soul, sent by Balemor the Hearth-Walker to comfort those who grieve. They appear as floating candle flames with soft, mournful light, and their presence means someone nearby needs comfort. The Pale Shepherds recognize them as allies; during Release, Candlewights often guide souls toward their final passage. Unlike Grief-Lanterns (which feed on sorrow), Candlewights ease it. Those who treat them gently report dreams of closure. Those who extinguish them carelessly sometimes find their own hope harder to kindle.

---

### River Minnow Swarm
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 2d6 (swarm acts as single entity)  
**Proficiency:** 0  
**Resolve:** 0  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** Swim 20 yards  

**Nipping Swarm** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 2d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD slashing damage (creatures in water within 5 yards)

**Special Abilities:**
- **Swarm:** Takes half damage from single-target attacks
- **Water-Bound:** Dies if removed from water for more than 1 round

**Tactics:** Swarms creatures bleeding in water. Disperses if reduced below half HD.

**Lore:** Mundane fish touched by Aluneth's memory currents. They remember ancient predators and attack anything that smells of blood. River-Kin sometimes guide them away from travelers.

---

### Ash Sprite
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 1d4  
**Proficiency:** 0  
**Resolve:** 1  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** 15 yards, fly 15 yards  

**Ember Burst** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 1d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD fire damage (5-yard radius, self-destructs)

**Special Abilities:**
- **Explosive Death:** When reduced to 0 HD, automatically triggers Ember Burst

**Tactics:** Floats near campfires and forges. If startled, panics and explodes.

**Lore:** Tiny elementals born from the Primal Flame, touched by Iosyx the Twin-Flame's chaos. They're not malicious—just unstable and easily frightened. Scholars debate whether they're alive or merely animated ash.

---

### Wyrmkin Whelp
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 1d6  
**Proficiency:** 0  
**Resolve:** 1  
**Armor:** Light (Scaled Hide)  
**Movement:** 10 yards  

**Crude Spear** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 1d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD piercing damage

**Special Abilities:**
- **Pack Tactics:** Gains +1d6 when attacking a target flanked by another Wyrmkin
- **Darkvision:** Sees perfectly in complete darkness out to 30 yards

**Tactics:** Attacks in groups of 4-6. Flees if isolated or if the brood's larger protector falls.

**Terrain/Environment:** Dragon lairs, volcanic caverns, underground warrens. Wyrmkin carve elaborate tunnel systems beneath their masters' domains.

**Lore:** The smallest and youngest of Wyrmkin society. Whelps serve as scouts, trap-tenders, and alarm-raisers for their broods. They worship true wyrms as divine beings and will sacrifice themselves without hesitation for their scaled masters. Despite their size, they're cunning—using ambush tunnels, tripwires, and coordinated strikes rather than direct confrontation.

---

### Cinderspawn
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 2d4  
**Proficiency:** 0  
**Resolve:** 1  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** 10 yards  

**Ember Touch** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 2d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD fire damage

**Special Abilities:**
- **Molten Core:** When reduced to 0 HD, deals 1 HD fire damage to all creatures within 2 yards
- **Fire Immunity:** Takes no damage from fire
- **Flame Sense:** Detects heat sources within 20 yards, even through walls

**Tactics:** Crawls toward heat sources. Multiple Cinderspawn cluster together, making their death-bursts overlap.

**Terrain/Environment:** Volcanic regions, forges, and areas scorched by dragonfire. Often found near Flame Wyrm nests, feeding on residual heat.

**Lore:** These small, lizard-like creatures are born from the cooling embers of dragonfire. They're not true dragons—merely parasitic fire-elementals drawn to draconic flame. Flame Wyrms tolerate them because Cinderspawn make excellent living alarms, rushing toward any intruder-shaped heat signature. Cultists of Iosyx sometimes collect them as pets, though "collection" usually ends in conflagration.

---

### Muck Slime
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 2d6  
**Proficiency:** 0  
**Resolve:** 0 (mindless)  
**Armor:** None (but see Amorphous)  
**Movement:** 5 yards, climb 5 yards  

**Pseudopod** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 1d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD acid damage

**Special Abilities:**
- **Mindless:** Cannot be affected by charm, fear, or psychic effects
- **Amorphous:** Can squeeze through gaps as small as 1 inch; +3d6 defense against slashing/piercing
- **Corrosive Body:** Creatures grappling or grappled by slime take 1 HD acid damage per round
- **Split:** When reduced below half HD by slashing damage, splits into two slimes with remaining HD divided between them

**Tactics:** Slowly approaches prey. Attacks closest creature. No tactics—purely reactive.

**Terrain/Environment:** Sewers, dungeons, caves, anywhere with moisture and organic matter to consume.

**Lore:** The simplest of oozes—leftover magical essence pooled with organic waste and given rudimentary hunger. Muck Slimes are found anywhere civilization builds and forgets to clean. Alchemists prize their residue for dissolving compounds, and some dungeons are "cleaned" by intentionally releasing slimes to consume vermin and the occasional unwary explorer.

---

### Greenskin Runt
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 1d6  
**Proficiency:** 0  
**Resolve:** 1  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** 10 yards  

**Crude Knife** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 1d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD piercing damage

**Sling** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 1d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD bludgeoning damage
- Range: 20 yards

**Special Abilities:**
- **Cowardly:** -2d6 to Resolve checks when not in group of 3+ Greenskins
- **Darkvision:** Sees in darkness to 30 yards
- **Scrounger:** Automatically finds 1d6 copper worth of salvage after combat if winner

**Tactics:** Attacks in groups, flees if outnumbered or if leader falls. Uses slings from cover, charges only when overwhelming.

**Terrain/Environment:** Cave systems, ruined structures, anywhere they can hide and ambush.

**Lore:** The smallest and weakest of Greenskin society—relegated to scouting, trap-setting, and being thrown at problems first. Runts dream of growing large enough to bully others, but most become food for their larger kin or adventurers. Despite their weakness, they're cunning survivors who've outlasted civilizations by hiding in the cracks. Born from the Tangled Verge's Withering aspect—life twisted toward survival at any cost.

---

### Street Urchin
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 1d6  
**Proficiency:** 0  
**Resolve:** 2  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** 12 yards  

**Shiv** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 1d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD piercing damage

**Special Abilities:**
- **Pickpocket:** +3d6 to Sleight of Hand when attempting to steal unattended or poorly-guarded items
- **Know the Streets:** Cannot become lost in urban environments; knows shortcuts
- **Scatter:** As a reaction when attacked, can move 5 yards without provoking opportunity attacks

**Tactics:** Distracts, steals, and runs. Never fights unless cornered. Works in groups to surround and confuse marks.

**Terrain/Environment:** Cities, towns, marketplaces, anywhere crowds gather.

**Lore:** Not every threat carries a sword. Street urchins survive through cunning and desperation rather than violence. Most work for larger criminal organizations, serving as lookouts, couriers, and pickpockets. Some are genuinely just hungry children; others are recruiters for darker purposes. Wise adventurers make allies of them rather than enemies—an urchin's knowledge of a city's secrets is worth more than their silver.

### Tomb Walker
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 2d6  
**Proficiency:** 0  
**Resolve:** 0 (mindless)  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** 8 yards  

**Clumsy Grasp** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 1d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD bludgeoning damage

**Special Abilities:**
- **Undead Fortitude:** Immune to poison, disease, fear, and charm; doesn't breathe or eat
- **Mindless:** Cannot be reasoned with or intimidated
- **Shambling Horror:** Living creatures seeing Tomb Walker for first time must make Resolve check or suffer -1d6 to next action (fear)
- **Aralys's Rejected:** Tomb Walkers are an affront to the Gloam; priests of Aralys deal +1 HD damage against them

**Tactics:** Advances toward nearest living creature. Attacks until destroyed. No self-preservation.

**Terrain/Environment:** Crypts, battlefields, plague pits, anywhere corpses rest without proper funeral rites.

**Lore:** When bodies are left without Aralys's blessing—denied proper burial or consumed by Withering—the corpse sometimes rises as a Tomb Walker. Unlike intelligent undead, they have no memories or purpose beyond movement and hunger. Necromancers prize them as expendable labor, though Aralys's faithful hunt them as affronts to death's sacred cycle. A single Tomb Walker is barely a threat; twenty is a crisis.

### Sewer Vermin Swarm
**Threat Tier:** Trivial (Swarm)  
**HD Pool:** 3d6 (swarm acts as single entity)  
**Proficiency:** 0  
**Resolve:** 0 (mindless)  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** 10 yards, climb 10 yards

**Tactics:** Flows toward warmth and food. Engulfs sleeping or incapacitated creatures first.

**Terrain/Environment:** Sewers, refuse heaps, dungeons, anywhere filth accumulates.

**Lore:** Rats, insects, and worse—bound together by hunger into a single crawling mass. Sewer vermin swarms are symptoms of urban neglect or magical corruption. Some cities employ ratcatchers with magical training; others simply accept the occasional swarm emergence as urban life. The truly paranoid note that swarms sometimes emerge in patterns, as if guided by unseen purpose.

- **Pack Tactics:** +1d6 to attacks if ally is within 5 yards of target

**Tactics:** Hunts in packs of 2-4. Uses Shadowy Lunge on weakest target, then standard bites. Flees if pack reduced to 1.

**Terrain/Environment:** Gloam-touched moors, forests at twilight, misty valleys. Gains +2d6 to stealth in total darkness or heavy fog. Uses elevated positions (hills, rock formations) for ambush. Avoids direct sunlight (-1d6 to all actions in bright light). Pack coordinates to drive prey into difficult terrain (thick undergrowth, fog banks) where vision is limited.

**Lore:** Wolves from the Gloam, touched by perpetual darkness. Their fur seems to drink light, and their eyes glow pale silver. They hunt the boundary between Mortal Weave and Gloam, preying on travelers who stray too close to Threshold Zones. Thalos permits their existence as reminders of consequence.

---

### Oath-Breaker Shade

**Tactics:** Targets those who have broken oaths, whispering their failures. Flees from those with strong conviction (Resolve 3+).

**Lore:** These are echoes of those who died with broken oaths, rejected by both the Concordant Halls and Aralys's mercy. They exist in torment, seeking to drag others into their guilt. The Hollow Vespers sometimes command them. Can only be truly destroyed by fulfilling the oath they broke in life.

---

### Vigil Shade
**Threat Tier:** Basic  
**HD Pool:** 4d6  
**Proficiency:** 1  
**Resolve:** 3  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** 10 yards  

**Denial Strike** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 2d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD psychic damage
- Special: Target must succeed on Resolve check or forget they were damaged (cannot tell how much HD they've lost until combat ends)

**Loop the Moment** (Advanced, 3+)
- Rolls: 3d6
- Required: 2
- Range: 15 yards
- Effect: Target is forced to repeat last action taken (whether successful or not). If they cannot repeat it (moved out of range, target gone), they lose their action entirely

**Special Abilities:**
- **Denial State:** Cannot be convinced it is dead. If reduced to 0 HD, reforms at sundown unless laid to rest with proper funeral rites
- **Vigil-Born:** Appears only during Vigil-tides in the Gloam or when someone refuses to accept a recent death
- **Familiar Face:** Appears as someone target has lost—a parent, friend, or comrade recently dead

**Tactics:** Doesn't understand it's fighting. Repeats last moments of its life endlessly. Attacks only those who interfere with its loop for anyone who forces it to acknowledge death.

**Terrain/Environment:** Appears at fresh graves, deathbeds, battlefield sites within days of a death. Most common during the Vigil Mourning State. Mist follows it. Time feels slower nearby.

**Lore:** When the Gloam's Vigil dominates a region, the recently dead sometimes fail to realize they've died. These Vigil Shades walk through their last moments in an infinite loop—eating breakfast, walking to market, dying, waking, eating breakfast again. They aren't hostile unless forced to confront reality. Wise travelers let them pass. Those who force closure too roughly may face a shade's desperate rage. The Pale Shepherds gently guide Vigil Shades toward Release when Remembrance arrives.

---

### Grief-Lantern
**Threat Tier:** Basic  
**HD Pool:** 3d8  
**Proficiency:** 2  
**Resolve:** 2  
**Armor:** None (incorporeal)

**Special Abilities:**

- **Mourner's Light:** Sheds pale, cold light in 20-yard radius. Undead within this light gain +1d6 to all actions
- **Feed on Sorrow:** Heals 1 HD whenever creature within 15 yards fails Resolve check

**Tactics:** Drifts silently, following those carrying grief. Uses Grief Beacon to weaken groups, then Sorrowlight on those who show emotional vulnerability.

**Terrain/Environment:** Floats above cemeteries, memorial sites, and places of recent tragedy. Common during Remembrance Mourning State but can appear anywhere death has touched.

**Lore:** Unlike Candlewights (which offer comfort), Grief-Lanterns are parasites that feed on unprocessed sorrow. They're believed to be stillborn Candlewights—comfort that never arrived, curdled into hunger. Balemor the Hearth-Walker is said to weep when he sees what his failed blessings become. The light they shed is beautiful but cold, and many travelers mistake them for guides before realizing the lantern leads only deeper into grief.

### Hollow Drifter
**Threat Tier:** Basic  
**HD Pool:** 5d6  
**Proficiency:** 2  
**Resolve:** 0 (cannot be reduced; has no will to break)

- Effect: 2 Resolve damage. If target reaches 0 Resolve, they become apathetic and cannot willingly act for 1d6 rounds

**Special Abilities:**
- **Hollow-Born:** Created when Hollow Mourning State strips identity from wandering souls
- **Faceless:** Has no face—just smoothed, featureless skin. Immune to effects requiring eye contact
- **Memory Null:** Creatures cannot remember Drifter's location if they look away. Must make Awareness check to track it
- **Hunger for Self:** Drawn to those with strong identities (high Resolve, defined goals)

**Tactics:** Drifts toward sources of identity and purpose. Attacks mechanically, without malice—it doesn't remember what malice is. Prioritizes targets with highest Resolve.

**Terrain/Environment:** Appears during Hollow Mourning States, or in places where mass forgetting has occurred (destroyed libraries, massacred villages with no survivors to remember). The air feels empty where they drift.

**Lore:** The Hollow is the Gloam's most dangerous Mourning State—grief that has curdled into emptiness, mourning that forgot what it mourned. Hollow Drifters are what remains of souls caught in the Hollow too long. They've forgotten everything: name, face, purpose, even the memory of having memories. They drift through the Gloam seeking what they lost, draining identity from others in vain hope of recovering their own. The Pale Shepherds can guide many souls, but Hollow Drifters are beyond even their reach—there's nothing left to guide.

**Lore:** Plant creatures animated by the Living Accord's overflow of growth energy. They defend ancient forests and sacred groves, attacking those who harm nature. Thymera's priests can speak with them and negotiate safe passage. Not evil, but protective and territorial.

---

### Bloom-Spawn
**Threat Tier:** Basic  
**HD Pool:** 4d8  
**Proficiency:** 1  
**Resolve:** 1

**Tactics:** Creates Seedlings to swarm enemies, uses Thorn Spray on grouped targets. Retreats toward sunlight if damaged. Does not pursue into darkness.

**Terrain/Environment:** Appears in areas where the Bloom Excess is ascendant—meadows choked with flowers, forests where growth outpaces decay. Common near threshold zones where Tangled Verge bleeds into Mortal Weave.

**Lore:** When the Bloom dominates the Tangled Verge, its ideology (*Growth must not slow*) spawns living avatars. Bloom-Spawn are walking gardens of impossible beauty, flowers emerging from humanoid shapes made of vine and nectar. They aren't hostile by nature—they simply proliferate, filling spaces with growth, treating other creatures as substrate for more Bloom. What they create is beautiful. What they replace is gone forever. The Verdant Synod attempts to moderate Bloom-Spawn, but during Bloom-tides, they proliferate faster than they can be culled.

### Withering Herald
**Threat Tier:** Basic  
**HD Pool:** 5d8

**Ripening Touch** (Basic, 2+)

- **Withering-Touched:** During Withering dominance in the Tangled Verge, gains +2d6 defense (harvest cannot be stopped)

**Tactics:** Approaches slowly, gesturing for prey to accept their time. Uses Harvest Scythe on weakened targets. Does not chase those who flee—they'll ripen eventually.

**Terrain/Environment:** Orchards where fruit falls endlessly, forests blanketed in autumn gold even in summer, fields of grain bowed heavy with seed. The Withering is not winter—it's the necessary maturation before rest.

**Lore:** Sentient expressions of the Withering Excess, these figures appear as orchard-ghosts wrapped in falling leaves and the scent of ripe fruit. They aren't death-bringers—they're harvesters. Their ideology (*All beauty must mature and fall*) makes them patient, accepting, even kind. A Withering Herald will warn travelers: "Your time approaches. Use it well." They become dangerous only when the Bloom grows too aggressive, racing to restore balance by forcing premature harvest. During Withering-tides, they walk in procession, bringing autumn wherever they go.

### Memory Echo

---

**Lore:** Mortals who have bound themselves so completely to Korthane the Coinbound that they've become extensions of the god's will. They enforce debts and contracts with supernatural authority. Neither fully alive nor dead, they exist in service to cosmic commerce. Can be bargained with but never cheat—every deal is "fair" according to their twisted logic.

**Tactics:** Whispers temptations to abandon oaths and community. Focuses on isolated targets. If engaged in combat, uses Draining Touch while whispering failures and weaknesses. Flees toward other Vespers if reduced below half HD.

**Lore:** The Hollow Vespers are echoes of those who refused the Balance—individuals who broke all bonds and died alone, consumed by betrayal and despair. They cannot be truly destroyed, only driven away. They serve no god but feed on broken communities and abandoned oaths. The Wardens and Hearthstones hunt them endlessly.

**Lore:** Elemental creatures born in volcanic regions where the Primal Flame burns brightest. They're touched by Iosyx's chaos and embody raw transformation. Skilled crafters sometimes befriend them, using their heat to forge legendary items. Murien of a Thousand Names is said to have learned smithing from salamander-song.

- **Antler Crown:** Antlers glow faintly in moonlight; magically sharp (counts as magical weapon)

**Tactics:** Peaceful unless provoked. If defending territory or young, uses Trampling Charge, then multiple Antler Gore attacks. Flees if reduced below half HD.

**Lore:** Majestic deer native to the Mortal Weave, touched by the Living Accord's blessing. Their antlers never stop growing, forming elaborate crowns by old age. They're sacred to Thymera and hunting them without permission brings her wrath. Their antlers are prized components for healing magic and druidic staffs.

**Tactics:** Prefers negotiation over violence. Will fight only if debt cannot be collected peacefully or if attacked first. Often works in pairs.

**Lore:** Mortal agents of Korthane the Coinbound, marked by the god to enforce cosmic balance in trade. They're not evil—merely implacable. Every debt must be paid, every contract honored. They can be reasoned with and will accept alternative payment, but never forgive a debt outright. Carry ledgers that supernaturally update when debts are incurred or paid.

---

**Lore:** The backbone of Wyrmkin military force. Warriors earn their position through combat trials, bearing scars proudly. They forge their own weapons from slag left by dragonfire—crude but effective. The greatest honor is to die in direct service to a true wyrm.

**Lore:** Distant cousins of true wyrms, reduced to bestial cunning over generations in toxic environments. They're territorial rather than intelligent, guarding hunting grounds fiercely. Alchemists prize their venom sacs, and their hide makes serviceable (if foul-smelling) leather armor.

**Terrain/Environment:** Volcanic regions, near Roiling Crucible rifts, and anywhere Iosyx's flame touches the Mortal Weave.

**Lore:** Young Flame Wyrms, only decades old but already dangerous. They're impulsive and territorial, claiming small lairs and hoarding anything shiny. Cults of Iosyx sometimes attempt to bond with Ember Wyrmlings—those who succeed gain potent allies; those who fail become kindling. Their scales shift between orange and red depending on mood, glowing brighter when angry.

**Tactics:** Circles prey, using Grief Exhalation to weaken groups before diving at isolated targets. Uses Shadow Form to escape when wounded.

**Terrain/Environment:** The Gloam's borders, graveyards, deathbed chambers, and places of mass grief.

**Lore:** Born from the Gloam where Aralys's influence touches draconic essence, these shadowy wyrmlings embody merciful death. Unlike malevolent undead, they're drawn to suffering rather than life itself—appearing where grief is sharpest. Some priests of Aralys believe they guide souls, but their predatory nature suggests otherwise. Their scales are the color of bruised twilight, and their eyes hold the soft glow of distant funeral pyres.

**HD Pool:** 3d8  
**Proficiency:** 1  
**Resolve:** 2

**Terrain/Environment:** Cave systems, forest edges, ruined structures, anywhere they can prepare ambush sites.

**Lore:** Full-grown Greenskins who've survived long enough to claim proper weapons and a place in raiding parties. They're still cowardly by human standards, but cunning—setting traps, using terrain, and picking fights they can win. Born from Withering essence, they embody survival through aggression. Some tribes have developed crude religions around Iosyx (chaos and fire) or darker powers.

**Tactics:** Forms line with allies. Uses shield to protect flanks. Fights professionally but not recklessly—survival matters more than glory.

**Terrain/Environment:** Battlefields, caravan routes, anywhere coin changes hands.

**Lore:** Professional soldiers who fight for pay rather than cause. Sellswords range from honorable mercenaries to barely-legal thugs. Most operate in companies with contracts, codes, and reputations to maintain. They're common guards, bodyguards, and hired muscle throughout the Mortal Weave. Some worship Korthane (god of fair exchange), viewing combat as transaction.

- **Dirty Fighter:** Once per combat, can blind target for 1 round (throw dirt, pocket sand)

**Tactics:** Avoids fair fights entirely. Backstabs isolated targets, then flees through prepared escape routes. Works with distraction partners.

**Terrain/Environment:** Cities, market districts, anywhere with crowds to blend into and shadows to hide in.

**Lore:** Thieves who've moved beyond petty pickpocketing to more dangerous work. Cutpurses specialize in ambush, mugging, and the occasional assassination. Most belong to guilds that provide fencing services, safe houses, and contracts. Some answer to Korthane (debts must be paid, even stolen ones), others to darker patrons who value their flexible morality.

### Hedge Mystic

**Terrain/Environment:** Village outskirts, forest edges, anywhere civilization meets wilderness.

**Lore:** Self-taught magic users who learned power from scraps—hedge witches, cunning folk, village wisewomen. They lack formal training but possess practical knowledge passed through generations. Most serve rural communities as healers and advisors, occupying uncertain space between respected and feared. Their magic draws from primal sources (Tangled Verge, Curator fragments) rather than structured domains.

### Zealot Initiate
**Threat Tier:** Basic  
**HD Pool:** 4d8  
**Proficiency:** 1  
**Resolve:** 3  
**Armor:** Light (Robes with hidden padding)

**Terrain/Environment:** Abandoned temples, secret basements, anywhere dark rituals can proceed undisturbed.

**Lore:** New converts to forbidden cults—still learning dark arts but already dangerous in their fervor. Zealot Initiates serve under more powerful clergy, performing grunt work: kidnapping sacrifices, guarding rituals, dying for the cause. Their patrons vary—Azravael's Schism (soul contracts), corrupted Gloam entities (death worship), Hollow Vespers (despair cults), or stranger things. Most were ordinary people before conversion, which makes them tragically relatable and utterly unreasonable.

### Acid Slime
**Threat Tier:** Basic  
**HD Pool:** 4d8  
**Proficiency:** 0  
**Resolve:** 0 (mindless)  
**Armor:** None (but see Amorphous)

- Required: 1
- Base: 2 HD acid damage

**Engulf** (Advanced, 3+)
- Rolls: 3d6
- Required: 2
- Effect: Target engulfed inside slime; takes 2 HD acid damage at start of each turn; restrained; must succeed Fortitude check to escape

**Special Abilities:**
- **Mindless:** Immune to charm, fear, psychic effects
- **Amorphous:** +3d6 defense vs slashing/piercing; squeezes through 1-inch gaps
- **Corrosive:** Dissolves metal; weapons hitting slime lose 1 durability per hit
- **Split:** When hit by slashing damage while above half HD, splits into two slimes with HD divided

**Tactics:** Moves toward organic matter. Engulfs smallest target first. No tactics—pure consumption drive.

**Terrain/Environment:** Dungeons, sewers, alchemical labs, anywhere magical or chemical waste accumulates.

**Lore:** More evolved than Muck Slimes—these oozes have developed stronger acids and predatory instincts. Some alchemists theorize they're magical experiments that escaped; others believe they naturally evolve from lesser slimes that consume enough magical material. Their acids can dissolve metal, making them threats to armored warriors. Smart dungeons use them as garbage disposal; smarter dungeons place them as guards.

### Skeletal Warrior
**Threat Tier:** Basic  
**HD Pool:** 4d8

- **Vulnerability:** Takes +1 HD damage from bludgeoning weapons

**Tactics:** Forms shield wall if multiple present. Attacks methodically without tactical adaptation. Follows last command literally until destroyed.

**Terrain/Environment:** Battlefields, crypts, necromancer lairs, anywhere dead warriors rest without Aralys's blessing.

**Lore:** Warriors denied Aralys's mercy, raised by necromancers as permanent soldiers. Unlike Tomb Walkers, Skeletal Warriors retain combat training—muscle memory literally etched into bone. They follow commands precisely but cannot improvise. Experienced adventurers know to target the necromancer controlling them rather than waste effort on the bones. Each skeleton was once someone; priests of Aralys consider destroying them a mercy.

### Wolf Pack

**Lore:** Natural predators that hunt cooperatively—not malicious, merely hungry. Wolf packs avoid healthy humanoid groups but target isolated, wounded, or elderly prey. Druids and rangers can communicate with them, sometimes negotiating passage or even temporary alliance. Some packs have been corrupted by Withering influence, becoming unnaturally aggressive.

**Lore:** Mortals who have walked between realms so often they've become attuned to planar boundaries. Often Shamans or Scholars who studied the Threshold Zones. Neither fully of one realm nor another, they serve as guides, thieves, or assassins depending on their nature. The Curator Arcanum watches them with interest, as they represent living proof of planar theory.

### Verdant Guardian
**Threat Tier:** Advanced  
**HD Pool:** 10d10

**Terrain/Environment:** Old-growth forests, sacred groves, living woodlands. Treats forest terrain as normal movement (ignores difficult terrain from undergrowth). Can "step" between trees within 30 yards as free movement (spends one action to teleport between large trees). Heavy forest canopy grants +2d6 defense (natural cover). Root Prison is much stronger in forests (targets need 4 successes instead of 3 to break free). Weakened if lured to barren ground (loses Regeneration, -1d6 to all actions).

**Lore:** Created by Thymera the Verdant-Mother to defend the Living Accord's most sacred spaces. They're not constructs but living extensions of the forest itself—ancient trees given mobility and purpose. Can communicate with druids and rangers through rustling leaves and root tremors. Destroying one wounds the forest itself, and Thymera feels each loss.

**Lore:** Mortals (or former mortals) who sold themselves completely to Azravael's infernal engine. They enforce the Schism-Scarred's twisted contracts across the realms. Each bears physical scars from the Schism—cracks in their skin glowing with infernal light. They remember their former lives but are compelled to serve. Can only be freed if their original contract is fulfilled or if Azravael releases them (which never happens).

**Lore:** Constructs created by wealthy merchants or temples of Korthane to guard vaults. Built from thousands of coins fused together, they embody the principle that wealth is power.

**Lore:** Sentient water spirits bound to Aluneth's memory currents. Each is tied to a specific river, lake, or stream and knows everything that has occurred near their waters. They speak in rhythmic patterns like flowing water. Can be bargained with for information—they value stories, songs, and preserved memories.

They exist in tormented limbo, driven only by need to complete their final promise. If helped to fulfill their oath, they thank their helpers and dissolve peacefully, finally accepted into Aralys's embrace. If their oath is impossible, they can be released through rituals invoking Thalos's mercy.

**Lore:** The most dangerous Hollow Vespers—those who actively seek to corrupt rather than merely feed on despair. They infiltrate communities, whispering doubts and twisting good intentions into harmful actions. Unlike lesser Vespers, Corruptors are organized and strategic. The Wardens hunt them relentlessly, and the Concordant Halls has marked them as anathema. Cannot be permanently destroyed but can be bound in sacred objects blessed by Ilyra or Nyroth.

**Terrain/Environment:** Flame Wyrm lairs, volcanic temples, Roiling Crucible shrines.

**Lore:** The priest-caste of Wyrmkin society. Flamecallers don't wield their own magic—they channel the raw elemental power of their wyrm masters through ritual scarification and devotion. Their scales are permanently discolored by repeated exposure to dragonfire, and their voices are hoarse from inhaling smoke. They interpret their masters' roars as divine pronouncements and lead religious ceremonies that culminate in live sacrifice to the flames.

- **Last Defender:** When reduced below half HD, gains +2d6 to all rolls until death

**Tactics:** Positions near eggs or wyrm masters. Uses Rally the Swarm at start of combat, then engages strongest threat with glaive. Never retreats from egg chambers.

**Terrain/Environment:** Wyrmkin egg vaults, nursery chambers, and guarding important passages in dragon lairs.

**Lore:** Elite warriors chosen to protect the next generation. Broodwardens undergo ritual scarring that binds them to the brood's collective instinct—they know when any Wyrmkin is in danger and where every egg rests. They rarely speak, communicating through gestures and pheromones. A Broodwarden failing their duty is executed by the wyrm master; one who succeeds is honored with dragon-blood baptism.

**Tactics:** Dive-bombs from clouds during storms, opening with Lightning Breath. Uses superior mobility to strafe earthbound targets. Retreats above cloud cover if grounded.

**Terrain/Environment:** Mountain peaks, stormy coastlines, and the Wild Expanse borderlands. Often found near Tempest shrines.

**Lore:** Drakes blessed (or cursed) by the Tempest aspect of the Wild Expanse. They're drawn to thunderstorms, riding air currents for days without rest. Sailors consider them omens—some say they herald salvation from becalmed seas, others say they bring lightning-strike death. Their scales crackle with static, and their bones can be crafted into lightning rods of extraordinary power.

**Tactics:** Ambushes from dense foliage. Opens with Thorn Volley to scatter groups, then picks off isolated prey. Climbs trees to escape superior numbers.

**Terrain/Environment:** Tangled Verge borders, ancient forests, overgrown ruins, and Thymera's sacred groves (though never harming druids).

**Lore:** Drakes that have bonded with the Living Accord's more aggressive aspects. Their scales sprout naturally sharp thorns that regrow within hours of being shed. Druids respect them as guardians of wild places, though they're territorial toward all intruders equally. Their thorns are prized for making enchanted caltrops and arrow tips.

### Adolescent Flame Wyrm
**Threat Tier:** Advanced

- **Heat Shimmer:** +2d6 defense against ranged attacks (heat distortion)
- **Darkvision:** Sees perfectly in darkness out to 120 yards

**Tactics:** Tests prey's strength with Frightful Presence before committing. Uses Flame Breath immediately, then closes to melee. Targets casters and healers first. Young enough to retreat if outmatched.

**Terrain/Environment:** Volcanic calderas, geothermal caves, and territories gifted by elder Flame Wyrms.

**Lore:** Flame Wyrms between 100 and 300 years old—old enough to claim territory, young enough to still be reckless. Adolescents are driven from their parents' lairs when they reach sufficient size, forced to carve out their own domains. This is when they're most dangerous—hungry, proud, and desperate to establish their place in wyrm hierarchy. Their scales haven't yet developed the deeper crimson of adults, showing more orange and gold.

### Veteran Sellsword
**Threat Tier:** Advanced  
**HD Pool:** 7d10  
**Proficiency:** 3  
**Resolve:** 3

**Special Abilities:**
- **Battle-Hardened:** Advantage on Resolve checks; immune to fear from creatures of lower tier
- **Mercenary Captain:** Grants +1d6 to all allied Sellswords within 20 yards
- **Know When to Fold:** If clearly outmatched, will negotiate rather than die
- **Second Wind:** Once per combat, heal 2d8 HD as bonus action

**Tactics:** Commands lesser sellswords, holding back until threats are identified. Engages strongest enemy personally. Uses Tactical Strike to finish wounded foes.

**Terrain/Environment:** Battlefields, mercenary camps, caravan routes, noble estates.

**Lore:** Sellswords who've survived enough campaigns to command. Veterans run mercenary companies, train guards, or serve as bodyguards to those who can afford them. They've seen magic, monsters, and the worst of mortal nature—nothing surprises them. Most follow a personal code: contracts are sacred, certain crimes aren't worth gold, professionals don't hold grudges. Some worship Korthane openly; all understand the transactional nature of violence.

### Shadowblade
**Threat Tier:** Advanced  
**HD Pool:** 6d8  
**Proficiency:** 3

- **Escape Artist:** +3d6 to escape grapples, bonds, or restraints

**Tactics:** Assassinates priority target immediately, then Shadow Steps to safety. Only engages in fair fight if no escape possible.

**Terrain/Environment:** Urban shadows, night-time anywhere, dungeons and crypts.

**Lore:** Elite assassins who've learned to step through darkness itself. Shadowblades serve guilds, noble patrons, or darker powers—Aralys's corrupted worshippers, Gloam entities, or those who've sworn themselves to Azravael for power. Their shadow-walking is not natural magic but a pact-gift, and each bears the Mark of Mercy somewhere on their body (twisted into Mark of Murder). Some remain professional; others have become addicted to killing.

### Greenskin Warchief
**Threat Tier:** Advanced  
**HD Pool:** 8d10  
**Proficiency:** 3  
**Resolve:** 4  
**Armor:** Medium (Looted Chainmail)  
**Movement:** 10 yards

- **Darkvision:** Sees in darkness to 60 yards
- **Survival of the Fittest:** Heals 1d6 HD whenever a nearby Greenskin dies (feeds on death)
- **Fear of Magic:** -2d6 to Resolve against spellcasters (instinctive terror of greater power)

**Tactics:** Commands from front lines, using Rallying Bellow early. Charges casters first (fear masking as aggression). Fights to death—fleeing Warchiefs are eaten by their own tribe.

**Terrain/Environment:** Greenskin strongholds, conquered ruins, caves large enough for tribes.

**Lore:** The largest and most brutal Greenskins rise to lead tribes through violence. Warchiefs are cunning in their brutality—they've learned to coordinate raids, use prisoners as shields, and retreat to fight another day. Each Warchief bears scars from challengers; their authority exists only as long as their strength. Born from concentrated Withering essence, they represent survival-through-domination. Some have made pacts with darker powers for additional strength, though such alliances rarely last.

### Cult Warlock
**Threat Tier:** Advanced  
**HD Pool:** 7d8  
**Proficiency:** 3  
**Resolve:** 4

**Dark Command** (Advanced, 3+) - Targets Resolve
- Rolls: 5d6
- Required: 2
- Range: 30 yards
- Effect: Target must make Resolve check or obey one simple command (approach, flee, drop weapon, etc.)

**Special Abilities:**
- **Patron's Gift:** Choose one - Fire Immunity, Cold Immunity, or +3d6 vs necrotic
- **Blood Magic:** Can sacrifice own HD (any amount) to add same number of d6 to any spell
- **Cult Leader:** +2d6 to social checks against Zealot Initiates
- **Dark Pact:** If reduced to 0 HD, patron may intervene (25% chance; restores to half HD)

**Tactics:** Stays behind initiates, casting Eldritch Bolt. Uses Dark Command on threats, Invoke Patron on groups. Sacrifices Blood Magic when desperate.

**Terrain/Environment:** Hidden temples, underground ritual chambers, corrupted shrines.

**Lore:** The true power behind cults—warlocks who've made pacts for magical gifts. Unlike scholars who study or priests who serve, warlocks transact. Their patrons vary: Azravael's Schism (soul-contracts for power), Hollow Vespers (despair-feeding for strength), corrupted Gloam entities (death-worship for necromancy), or stranger things from beyond the established cosmology. Each warlock believes they've made the better bargain; most discover otherwise eventually.

### Gelatinous Maw
**Threat Tier:** Advanced  
**HD Pool:** 8d10  
**Proficiency:** 2  
**Resolve:** 0 (mindless)  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** 6 yards  

**Engulf** (Advanced, 3+)

- Rolls: 4d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 3 HD acid damage
- Special: 10-yard reach (pseudopod extends)

**Special Abilities:**
- **Mindless:** Immune to charm, fear, psychic effects
- **Transparent:** +5d6 to Stealth in dungeons; creatures often walk into it
- **Amorphous:** Immune to prone, grapple, restrain conditions; squeezes through any gap
- **Absorption:** Metal, wood, and organic matter inside dissolves; creatures engulfed cannot use gear
- **Split:** Takes half damage from slashing; does not split like lesser slimes

**Tactics:** Remains still in corridor, waiting for prey to walk inside. Engulfs nearest creature, then moves toward others.

**Terrain/Environment:** Dungeon corridors (perfectly sized to fill passages), sewage systems, underground ruins.

**Lore:** The apex of mindless ooze evolution—nearly invisible cubes that fill dungeon corridors completely. Gelatinous Maws were likely created by wizards seeking self-maintaining dungeon cleaners; they've since propagated to any underground space with sufficient organic matter. Veteran dungeoneers prod corridors with long poles before entering. The truly unlucky find trapped victims still alive inside, slowly dissolving but unable to scream with acid-filled lungs.

### Wight Lord
**Threat Tier:** Advanced  
**HD Pool:** 9d10  
**Proficiency:** 3  
**Resolve:** 4  
**Armor:** Heavy (Ancient Plate, 2d8 temp HD)  
**Movement:** 10 yards  

**Life-Draining Blade** (Advanced, 3+)
- Rolls: 6d6
- Required: 2
- Base: 4 HD necrotic damage
- Special: Wight Lord heals HD equal to half damage dealt

**Death's Grasp** (Advanced, 3+)

- Effect: Control up to 6 HD worth of mindless undead; they follow commands until destroyed

**Special Abilities:**
- **Undead Lord:** Immune to poison, disease, fear, charm, sleep; doesn't breathe or eat
- **Create Spawn:** Humanoids killed by Wight Lord rise as Tomb Walkers after 1 hour
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** -2d6 to all rolls in direct sunlight
- **Aralys's Anathema:** Priests of Aralys deal +2 HD damage; radiant damage cannot be healed for 1 hour

**Tactics:** Commands lesser undead to engage while draining life from strongest opponent. Creates spawn to replenish forces. Retreats to darkness if wounded.

**Terrain/Environment:** Crypts, battlefields where nobles fell, cursed manors, anywhere powerful dead rest without Aralys's blessing.

**Lore:** Unlike mindless undead, Wight Lords retain their intelligence—and often their memories. They were warriors, nobles, or commanders in life who refused death's mercy, clinging to existence through sheer will or dark bargains. Each Wight Lord remembers who they were, which makes them tragically dangerous—some seek to rebuild fallen kingdoms, others pursue vendettas centuries old. Priests of Aralys consider them the most offensive violations of death's sanctity.

### Orc Berserker
**Threat Tier:** Advanced  
**HD Pool:** 8d10  
**Proficiency:** 3  
**Resolve:** 4 (but see Blood Rage)

**Special Abilities:**

- **Relentless:** Once per combat, when reduced to 0 HD, may make one final attack before falling
- **Darkvision:** Sees in darkness to 30 yards
- **Iosyx's Blessing:** Fire damage heals rather than harms (rare—only Crucible-blessed orcs)

**Tactics:** Uses Rage Bellow immediately, then charges with Reckless Assault at strongest enemy. No tactical consideration—pure aggression until death.

**Terrain/Environment:** Tribal lands, raiding paths, anywhere the strong rule.

**Lore:** Unlike Greenskins (twisted by Withering), Orcs are children of the Roiling Crucible—born from Iosyx's chaos-flame given flesh. They're not malicious by nature but value strength above all else. Berserkers are the most devoted to this philosophy, surrendering reason for power. Some tribes worship Iosyx directly; others have developed unique philosophies around survival-through-combat. Orcs can be negotiated with (they respect strength), though Berserkers specifically often cannot stop once blood rage takes them.

### Bandit Captain
**Threat Tier:** Advanced  
**HD Pool:** 7d10

**Special Abilities:**
- **Cunning Leader:** +2d6 to tactical planning and ambush setup
- **Escape Route:** Always has prepared escape; +3d6 to flee when combat turns against them
- **Negotiator:** +2d6 to social checks regarding surrender, ransoms, and deals
- **Criminal Network:** Can fence goods, find safe houses, and gather information in any settlement

**Tactics:** Commands from mid-line, using Rally the Lads first. Engages distracted targets with Dirty Tricks, retreats through prepared routes if overwhelmed.

**Terrain/Environment:** Forest ambush points, hidden camps, roadside positions with escape routes.

**Lore:** Not all criminals lack sophistication. Bandit Captains run operations—planning raids, managing personnel, fencing goods, and paying bribes. Most were soldiers, guards, or merchants before circumstances pushed them outside law. They maintain codes: no unnecessary killing (corpses attract attention), honor ransoms (reputation matters), protect their people (loyalty keeps operations running). Many pray to Korthane for successful transactions, even illegal ones.

### Militia Squad
**Threat Tier:** Advanced (Squad)  
**HD Pool:** 8d8 (5-8 militia with sergeant)

- **Citizens First:** Will retreat to protect civilians even if tactically inadvisable

**Tactics:** Forms spear wall at chokepoints. Uses Shield Formation against strong attacks. Fights defensively, buying time for reinforcements or civilian evacuation.

**Terrain/Environment:** Town squares, defensive walls, anywhere citizens protect their homes.

**Lore:** Not soldiers but citizens who've trained together—farmers, smiths, merchants united by defense of home. Militia squads lack professional discipline but compensate with determination and local knowledge. They're commanded by sergeants (often retired soldiers or guards) who maintain order through respect rather than authority. When militia falls, it means everything has fallen; they fight accordingly.

They're not angels but manifestations of collective commitment given form. Can be reasoned with if one's oaths are true. Appear as figures in ornate armor with faces obscured by glowing helms. Speak in perfect harmonic chords. Return to the Halls when their mission is complete.

**Lore:** Ancestral shades elevated to greater power, chosen by the collective will of the Hearthstones. They guard places where the Mortal Weave is thin, preventing unwanted planar incursions. Each was a great hero in life who swore to protect their people even in death. Can communicate with living descendants and often provide guidance. Accept offerings of memory (stories, songs, tributes to the dead).

### Primal Wyrm

**Primal Breath** (Legendary, 5+)

- Special: Ignites/freezes/electrifies terrain (creates difficult terrain)

**Coil and Crush** (Expert, 4+)
- Rolls: 8d6
- Required: 3
- Base: 4 HD bludgeoning damage to grappled target
- Special: Automatically succeeds if target is already grappled

**Wing Buffet** (Advanced, 3+)
- Rolls: 6d6
- Required: 2
- Effect: All creatures within 10 yards must make Fortitude skill roll or be knocked prone and pushed 10 yards
- Does not deal damage

**Special Abilities:**
- **Frightful Presence:** When wyrm roars, all enemies within 30 yards must make Resolve check or lose 1 Resolve and suffer -2d6 penalty on next action
- **Living Accord's Fury:** Embodies raw nature; Resistance to one element depending on environment
- **Legendary Resilience:** Can reroll failed defense once per round
- **Keen Senses:** +3d6 to Awareness checks

**Tactics:** Opens with Frightful Presence, then Primal Breath on groups. Uses Devastating Bite to grapple strongest warrior, then Coil and Crush. Wing Buffet to knock back swarming enemies. Flees to lair if reduced below 1/3 HD.

**Terrain/Environment:** Mountain peaks, deep canyons, wild coastlines—anywhere primal nature dominates. Uses flight to maintain positional advantage (elevated attacks gain +1d6). Wing Buffet near cliff edges to knock enemies off (falling damage 1 HD per 10 yards). Breath weapon shapes terrain (fire breath creates burning zones dealing 1 HD/round, ice breath creates difficult terrain, etc.). Can burrow to create ambush opportunities or escape underground. Lair is typically cave system with narrow entrance (chokepoint) and multiple vertical levels. Creates rockslides with roar (2 HD bludgeoning in 30-yard line). Wyrms claiming coastal territories use tidal patterns tactically.

**Lore:** Ancient draconic creatures born from the Living Accord's primal energies. Not true dragons but their lesser cousins—powerful but mortal. They claim territories (mountains, forests, swamps) and defend them jealously. Each wyrm embodies its environment's elemental nature. Thymera and Darthun both claim dominion over them, causing theological debates among druids. Can live for centuries and accumulate vast knowledge. Some serve as guardians of sacred groves; others as destructive forces. Can be bargained with if offering is significant (ancient knowledge, rare treasures, or promises of protection).

### Sorrow Leech
**Threat Tier:** Expert  
**HD Pool:** 10d8  
**Proficiency:** 4  
**Resolve:** 2  
**Armor:** Ethereal hide (2d8 temp HD)  
**Movement:** Fly 15 yards (hover), phasing  

**Psychic Drain** (Expert, 4+)
- Rolls: 8d6 (requires 1 exertion minimum)
- Required: 3
- Base: 3 HD psychic damage
- Range: 15 yards
- Special: Leech heals HD equal to damage dealt

**Amplify Grief** (Legendary, 5+) - Social Attack
- Rolls: 10d6 (requires 2 exertion minimum)
- Required: 3
- Targets Resolve of all enemies within 20 yards
- Base: 2 Resolve damage to each
- Special: Target painful memories; creatures with tragic backstories take 3 Resolve damage instead

**Possession** (Legendary, 5+)
- Rolls: 9d6 (requires 3 exertion minimum)
- Required: 3
- Targets Resolve
- Range: Touch
- Effect: Enter target's body. Target must make Resolve check (Legendary, 5+, requires 3 successes) each round or remain possessed. While possessed, Leech controls actions but takes half any damage target receives

**Special Abilities:**
- **Ethereal:** Incorporeal; physical attacks pass through unless magical
- **Emotion Sense:** Can detect strong emotions (grief, guilt, despair) within 60 yards
- **Invisible:** Naturally invisible; requires Awareness (Expert, 4+) to detect
- **Vulnerability (Radiant):** Takes double damage from radiant

**Tactics:** Remains invisible, using Amplify Grief to weaken groups. Possesses target with lowest Resolve. Flees into ethereal plane if threatened.

**Terrain/Environment:** Most active during Remembrance and Vigil Mourning States. Drawn to funerals, battlefields, deathbeds, and memorials. Avoids areas in Release (nothing left to feed on) and flees from the Hollow (even parasite needs prey with something to drain). Follows the grief-heavy, sometimes for weeks.

**Lore:** Parasitic entities from the Gloam that feed on sorrow and grief. Unlike Hollow Vespers (which *create* despair), Sorrow Leeches merely consume it—filling an ecological niche within the Gloam's emotional weather. During Vigil, they gorge on denial; during Remembrance, they feast on active mourning. They're most dangerous when the Gloam's grief accumulates faster than it can process, and Sorrow Leeches multiply to consume the excess.

Not inherently evil—they're predators, and predators serve functions. Balemor the Hearth-Walker tolerates them because grief that festers too long becomes the Hollow, and Hollow Drifters cannot be saved. Better a Sorrow Leech drain your sorrow than let it consume you entirely. The Pale Shepherds sometimes *guide* grieving souls toward Sorrow Leeches when grief threatens to trap them in Vigil forever—a painful mercy.

Can be driven away by celebrations of life and strong community bonds. Priests of Ilyra ward against them with hearthstone charms. The Moonbound Choir regards them as necessary evils, distasteful but part of the Gloam's balance.

**Lore:** Primordial beings born in volcanic cores where Iosyx's chaos meets earthly fire. They're not elementals but living embodiments of transformation through flame. Most slumber for centuries, waking only when volcanic activity surges. Some cultures worship them as gods of renewal (fire clears the old for new growth). Can be reasoned with by those bearing Iosyx's mark or offering rare minerals (diamonds, rubies) which they consume. Each Titan has unique personality—some benevolent, others destructive.

**Lore:** Aberrations that feed on memories, stealing them permanently. Unlike Memory Echoes (which replay memories), Devourers consume them—erasing events from victim's mind. They're violations of Aluneth's domain, and she has placed bounties on them. Each Devourer appears different based on memories consumed—shifting form reflects stolen identities. Can be found near libraries, elder councils, or ancient battlefields. Destroying one releases some memories (GM can return one significant memory to party member). Rumored to be created by Velkir the Ash-Tongued as weapons against history itself.

**Tactics:** Opens with Infernal Presence to terrify enemies. Uses Chains of Azravael on primary threat, then Ruinous Blade on others. Calls reinforcements if outnumbered. Offers contracts to weakened foes ("Your soul for your life").

**Lore:** Champions of Azravael who have fully embraced the Schism. They were once heroes who made desperate bargains and now enforce Azravael's contracts across realms. Each remembers their former life and the moment they fell—some regret it, others embrace damnation. Bear titles like "Knight of Broken Oaths" or "Enforcer of Eternal Debt." Can only be permanently destroyed if their original contract is somehow voided (nearly impossible). The Concordant Halls considers them abominations—oath-wielders turned against the very concept of honor.

### Wyrmkin Warlord
**Threat Tier:** Expert  
**HD Pool:** 12d10  
**Proficiency:** 4

**Terrain/Environment:** Dragon strongholds, Wyrmkin war camps, anywhere a true wyrm has established dominance.

**Lore:** The supreme military authority among Wyrmkin, second only to the wyrm itself. Warlords have drunk dragon blood, eaten wyrm-blessed flesh, and bear ritually carved scales as armor. They speak with the authority of their masters—defying a Warlord is defying the wyrm. Their axes are forged by Flamecallers using the master's breath, making each weapon unique. When a wyrm dies, its Warlord either dies in vengeance combat or goes into exile, hunting those responsible forever.

**Terrain/Environment:** Volcanic mountain territories, major geothermal zones, Roiling Crucible border realms.

**Lore:** Flame Wyrms between 300 and 800 years old—fully grown but not yet ancient. They've established territories, gathered Wyrmkin servants, and begun accumulating hoards. Young Wyrms are the ones most likely to be encountered by adventurers—they're active, territorial, and haven't yet learned the patience that comes with centuries. Their scales have deepened to rich crimson, and their flames burn hot enough to melt steel. Some Young Wyrms serve Iosyx directly; others merely embody the Twin-Flame's chaotic nature.

**Terrain/Environment:** The Gloam borderlands, ancient battlegrounds, mass graves, places of historic tragedy.

**Lore:** Gloamwyrms aged 200-600 years—mature enough to claim territory in the spaces between life and death. They embody Aralys's complex relationship with mortality: neither cruel nor kind, simply drawn to endings. They don't cause death so much as witness it, feeding on the grief left behind. Priests of Aralys can sometimes negotiate safe passage or even alliance—these wyrms honor the Death-Tender's servants. Their scales appear solid but shift like smoke when viewed from the corner of the eye.

### Frostscale Wyrm

**HD Pool:** 14d10  
**Proficiency:** 4

**Lore:** Neither aligned with the Tangled Verge's cycles nor touched by Iosyx's flame—Frostscale Wyrms embody pure elemental cold, the stillness before and after life. They're ancient beyond reckoning, having slept through cataclysms and awakened unchanged. Their territories are permanent winter, and entire civilizations have migrated to avoid their expansion. Unlike other wyrms, they don't hoard gold (too soft)—they collect frozen moments: a waterfall suspended mid-cascade, prey preserved in perfect ice tableaux, sometimes even heroes flash-frozen in heroic poses.

They guard the most sacred thresholds and oath-sites. Can speak all languages and prefer diplomacy to violence—only fight when oaths are violated. Each Drake has a specific domain (Justice, Memory, Protection, etc.). Slaying one without just cause brings the wrath of the entire Concordant Halls.

Each carries staff crowned with symbol of the moon. They guide heroes, monarchs, and those whose deaths carry cosmic weight. Can be encountered at major story moments (death of kings, apocalyptic battles, etc.). Speaking with one is said to change a person—you see your own death reflected in their mask. Not enemies unless you actively prevent death's natural course (lichdom, true resurrection, etc.).

**Lore:** Ancient trees given mobility and consciousness by Thymera millennia ago to defend the most sacred groves. Each is unique—personality shaped by centuries of observation. Some are gentle gardeners; others wrathful defenders. They speak in slow, creaking voices like old wood settling and consider decades like mortals consider hours. Destroying one is cosmic-level crime against nature—Thymera herself may manifest to punish slayers. However, Colossi respect worthy opponents and may yield if given reason (druidic entreaty, oath of protection, etc.). Their heartwood is most potent magical component in existence—worth kingdoms but guarded by all nature.

### Adult Flame Wyrm
**Threat Tier:** Legendary  
**HD Pool:** 18d12

**Terrain/Environment:** Active volcanoes, the Roiling Crucible border realms, deserts scorched by ancient fires.

**Lore:** Flame Wyrms aged 800 to 2,000 years—fully mature and at the height of their power. Each rules a territory the size of a kingdom, with Wyrmkin armies numbering in the hundreds. They've accumulated hoards that could bankrupt nations and memories spanning civilizations. Adults are intelligent enough for complex negotiation—some have made treaties with mortal kingdoms, demanding tribute in exchange for protection or mere tolerance. They embody Iosyx's twin nature: capable of both creative warmth (forging alliances, granting fire-magic blessings) and destructive chaos (razing cities, igniting wars). Their scales are deep crimson verging on black at the edges, and their fire burns blue-white at the core.

**Tactics:** Calls storm immediately upon detecting intruders. Uses extreme flight speed for hit-and-run tactics. Tempest Breath targets clusters or lines of enemies. Rarely lands during combat—prefers strafing runs.

**Terrain/Environment:** Mountain peaks above cloud level, permanent storm zones, Wild Expanse borderlands.

**Lore:** Ancient wyrms who have bonded completely with Tempest, the storm-aspect of the Wild Expanse. Unlike other wyrms, they don't accumulate hoards—they collect storms, driving weather systems across continents for their amusement. Each Stormwyrm remembers every thunderstorm it has ridden since birth, a library of meteorological fury. They're neither good nor evil by mortal understanding—simply force of nature given will. Sailors both fear and revere them; some port cities make offerings to known Stormwyrms in hopes of calm seas. Their scales constantly crackle with lightning, and their roars sound like thunderclaps. Older ones sometimes develop philosophical outlooks, seeing themselves as agents of necessary change—storms that clear dead wood.

**Terrain/Environment:** Planar boundaries, areas where reality thins, Curator Arcanum border zones (hunting knowledge), the void between stars.

**Lore:** Wyrms that have gazed too long into the spaces between planes and been changed. Voidwyrms are what happens when draconic greed turns toward magic itself—they hoard spells, consuming magical energy as sustenance. They're hated by mages and priests alike, for a Voidwyrm's hunting ground becomes a dead zone for magic. Some theorize they're the Curator's failed experiments; others believe they're natural predators evolved to hunt magical creatures. They don't speak aloud—only telepathically, and their thoughts feel like static and silence. Their scales show glimpses of distant stars. The Weaver's Guild has standing bounties on Voidwyrm remains, though the parts are dangerous to handle—they continue consuming magic even after death.

Each Herald was once a mortal king, hero, or saint who made the ultimate bargain. They appear as towering figures in ornate infernal armor, faces hidden behind masks of contract-signed bone. They speak in perfect legalese, every word binding. Can negotiate—all Heralds seek souls for Azravael's engine. Defeating one requires either military might (level 10 party), divine intervention, or finding loophole in the Herald's own binding contract. If destroyed, returns after 99 years unless original contract voided.

**The Final Mercy** (Special) - Ritual
- Requires 3 rounds of uninterrupted concentration
- Range: 100 yards
- Effect: Grant peaceful death to all willing souls within range. For unwilling, must succeed on Resolve check (Ultimate, 6 only) to resist. Those who pass are granted Aralys's blessing and skip any suffering in death

**Special Abilities:**
- **Aralys's Avatar:** Direct manifestation of goddess's will; immune to necrotic and radiant damage
- **Deathless:** Cannot be reduced below 1 HD by any means
- **Ethereal Form:** Can become incorporeal at will
- **Psychopomp Authority:** +5d6 to all checks involving death, mercy, or judgment
- **Remember All:** Knows true name and death of every mortal ever lived

**Tactics:** Does not seek combat—appears only when cosmic balance of death is threatened (mass lichdom, true resurrection abuse, etc.). If forced to fight, uses Moonlight Cascade to cleanse undead, then Veil Between to show mortals their fate. Touch of Mercy only for those truly suffering.

**Lore:** Aralys rarely manifests directly, but when death's natural order faces existential threat, she sends an Aspect—fragment of her consciousness given form. Aspects appear as beautiful figures shrouded in moonlight with eyes that reflect your death. They speak gently but with absolute authority. Cannot be defeated through violence (Deathless ability) but can be reasoned with. If you face an Aspect, someone has violated death's sanctity on cosmic scale. Aspects have granted mercy to heroes who convinced them their cause was just. Each encounter with an Aspect changes you forever—you've looked into death itself and seen mercy waiting.

**Terrain/Environment:** The Gloam's deepest reaches, sites of ancient massacres, places where thousands died at once.

**Lore:** Gloamwyrms that have existed for millennia—so old they've become extensions of Aralys's will rather than merely creatures of her realm. Elder Gloamwyrms remember every death they've witnessed, a library of endings spanning civilizations. They don't kill for sustenance; they kill because death is their nature, their service, their devotion. Each has a name known only to Aralys: titles like "Keeper of Forgotten Pyres" or "The Grief That Walks." They appear as massive serpentine forms of solidified dusk, their scales showing glimpses of final moments—a face at peace, a hand reaching out, a last breath. They can be negotiated with by those who genuinely respect death's necessity, and have been known to ally with mortals against necromancers or those who abuse resurrection. To destroy one is to anger Aralys herself.

### Covenant Wyrm
**Threat Tier:** Ultimate  
**HD Pool:** 22d12  
**Proficiency:** 6

- Special: Recharge after 3 rounds; all oathbreakers in range take double damage and must make Resolve check or be compelled to confess one broken oath aloud

**Seal of the Halls** (Ultimate, 6 only) - Binding
- Rolls: 14d6 (requires 3 exertion minimum)
- Required: 5
- Target: One creature within 30 yards who has broken an oath
- Effect: Target is banished to the Concordant Halls for judgment. Returns after 24 hours bearing magical geas to fulfill original oath—breaking the geas results in permanent service to the Halls

**Invoke Concordance** (Legendary, 5+) - Command
- Rolls: 12d6 (requires 2 exertion minimum)
- Required: 4
- Range: 100-yard radius
- Effect: All creatures must make Resolve check or be compelled to honor any oath they've sworn to creatures present. Lasts for duration of encounter.

- **Legendary Resistance (3/day):** Can choose to succeed on a failed defense

- **Radiant Immunity:** Immune to radiant damage

**Tactics:** Opens with Invoke Concordance to reveal oathbreakers. Targets oathbreakers with Judgment Bite and Seal of the Halls. Uses Breath of Covenant when multiple oathbreakers cluster. Absolutely will not attack proven oath-keepers—even mid-combat, will fly over them to reach guilty parties.

**Terrain/Environment:** The Concordant Halls themselves, sites of historic treaty-signing, wherever sacred oaths have been massively violated.

**Lore:** The rarest and most revered of all wyrms—creatures born from the Concordant Halls themselves rather than the material plane. Covenant Wyrms are living embodiments of sacred promise, existing to ensure that sworn oaths carry weight across all planes. They appear as massive dragons of white and gold, scales inscribed with every oath ever witnessed, eyes burning with judicial certainty. Unlike most wyrms, they don't claim territory or accumulate hoards—they serve the Halls directly, manifesting when cosmic oaths face violation. Even evil creatures show them respect, for Covenant Wyrms judge by oath keeping, not moral alignment. A demon who keeps its word has nothing to fear; a paladin who broke a vow will be called to account. They can be called upon by those of pure Concordant faith to witness and seal unbreakable agreements—but invoking one without true need is considered grave disrespect.

## Mythical Tier Creatures

*Reality-warping cosmic forces (Beyond Level 10)*

---

**HD Pool:** 25d20  
**Proficiency:** 6  
**Resolve:** 4 (constantly fluctuates)  
**Armor:** Chaotic form (2d20 temp HD, changes element/type each round)  
**Movement:** Variable (roll 1d20 for yards per round), fly, teleport, irregular  

**Chaos Incarnate** (Mythical, variable)
- Rolls: 16d6
- Required: Roll 1d6 to determine (changes each use)
- Base: 8 HD damage (type changes each round: fire, cold, lightning, acid, force, psychic)

  3. All creatures swap positions randomly
  4. Time dilates (extra round for all)
  5. Elements invert (fire becomes cold, etc.)
  6. All weapons become flowers
  7. Physical laws suspend (flight without wings, walk through walls)
  8. All creatures speak unknown language
  9. Emotions made visible (auras of feeling)
  10. Roll twice, combine effects

**Transformation Wave** (Mythical)
- Rolls: 20d6 (requires 3 exertion minimum)

- Range: 50-yard cone
- Effect: All in area must make Resolve check (Ultimate, 6 only) or be transformed into random creature (GM determines, lasts 1 hour)

- **Elemental Omnibus:** Immune to all elemental damage and can change to any element at will
- **Reality Slip:** Automatically succeeds on all defense rolls on natural 6
- **Iosyx's Nature:** Embodies cosmic change; alters local physics just by existing
- **The Twin Flames:** Simultaneously creates and destroys; all damage dealt also heals Fragment by same amount

**Tactics:** No tactics—pure chaos. Attacks random targets with random abilities. Reality Flux spontaneously when "interested" (GM discretion). Transformation Wave for "fun."

**Lore:** Not Iosyx herself but a fragment shed during a moment of extreme cosmic change (creation of a star, birth of new realm, etc.). Fragments "exist" only loosely—they're more concepts given temporary form. Encountering one is catastrophic event remembered for generations. They don't "want" anything—they simply ARE change. Cannot be reasoned with or bargained with. Only "defeated" by channeling into controlled change (transform into something stable) or waiting until Fragment's energy dissipates naturally (days or weeks of chaos). Some cults worship Fragment appearance as sign of coming transformation. Scholars who survive encounter sometimes gain insight into fundamental nature of reality.

### The Tidebound Memory (Aluneth's Echo)
**Threat Tier:** Mythical  
**HD Pool:** 28d12  
**Proficiency:** 7  
**Resolve:** 10 (cannot be reduced)  
**Armor:** Flowing water form (2d20 temp HD, infinite regeneration in water)  
**Movement:** 30 yards, swim 60 yards, water walk

- Range: 40-yard cone
- Effect: Overwhelm targets with all memories stored in local water (centuries of events). Creatures must make Resolve check (Ultimate, 6 only) or collapse unconscious for 1d4 hours

**Tactics:** Does not seek combat—appears when someone attempts to erase history or rewrite collective memory. First uses Memory Flood to show truth, then Aluneth's Judgment to force accountability. Rewrite History only in most extreme cases (usually to undo damage done by others). Tide of Forgetting as Last resort against those who refuse to accept truth.

**Lore:** Appears when Aluneth herself manifests concern over historical revisionism, mass memory erasure, or attempt to unmake events. Looks like figure made of flowing water shaped by all memories held within—constantly shifting to show different historical moments. Speaks in chorus of voices (all who contributed to these memories). Cannot lie and forces truth upon world. Encountering Echo means you're part of event so significant it will be remembered eternally. Scholars debate whether Echo is Aluneth herself or merely her strongest manifestation. Either way, it represents infinite weight of history made manifest. Can be "reasoned" with only by accepting truth and committing to preserve memory.

- **Progenitor Presence:** All dragons within 1 mile recognize Progenitor's authority—most will not attack; hostile dragons have -4d6 to all rolls
- **Elemental Transcendence:** Immune to fire, cold, lightning, acid, and poison damage
- **Cannot Be Banished:** Immune to effects that would remove it from the plane
- **Ancient Mind:** Immune to charm, fear, and psychic effects; has True Sight to 500 yards
- **The First Clutch:** Can speak to and command any creature with draconic blood (Wyrmkin, drakes, half-dragons) within 1 mile
- **Lair Action (Active in Lair):** At initiative count 20, one of:
  - Magma erupts in 4 random 10-yard radius areas (5 HD fire damage)
  - Earthquake topples structures and creates difficult terrain
  - Wind blast pushes all flying creatures 40 yards in chosen direction

**Tactics:** Opens with Summon Lineage for support, then uses Breath of Ages (Destruction) on main force. Engages most powerful threat personally while progeny handle others. Uses Breath of Ages (Change) on particularly annoying enemies. Retreats only if genuinely outmatched—extremely rare.

**Terrain/Environment:** The world's oldest volcanic calderas, caverns beneath mountains, places where the primal fire still burns. Said to lair in impossible spaces—entire kingdoms inside single mountains.

**Lore:** Before true gods walked, before the Mortal Weave was fully formed, the Progenitors crawled from the cosmic fires. They are neither creations nor creators—they simply were first. Each Progenitor is ancestor to entire lineages of wyrms; the Flame Wyrms trace descent from one, Frostscales from another, Gloamwyrms from a third. They've slept for ages, waking only when their children face existential threat or when cosmic events disturb their slumber. A Progenitor appearing is world-ending event—nations empty their treasuries for tribute, gods take notice, and the very landscape reshapes around the ancient one's whims. They don't think as mortals do; they remember creation and consider civilizations as mortals consider mayflies. Can theoretically be negotiated with, but their concerns are so vast that finding common ground is nearly impossible. Killing one would echo through all draconic bloodlines—every wyrm would know and respond.

**Threat Tier:** Mythical  
**HD Pool:** 35d12  
**Proficiency:** 8  
**Resolve:** 8 (but see Chaos Resolve)  
**Armor:** Living Flame (cannot be reduced to temp HD 0 while fire exists nearby)  
**Movement:** 20 yards, fly 80 yards, teleport (to any fire source) unlimited  

**Creation Bite** (Mythical)
- Rolls: 20d6
- Required: 6
- Base: 10 HD fire + 5 HD radiant damage
- Special: Target is marked with First Fire—takes 3 HD fire damage per round indefinitely; only holy water, total immersion, or divine intervention removes it

**Destruction Claw** (Ultimate, 6 only)
- Rolls: 18d6
- Required: 5
- Base: 9 HD fire damage
- Special: Permanently destroys magic items (no save); artifacts get Resolve check to resist

**Tail of Change** (Ultimate, 6 only)
- Rolls: 16d6
- Required: 5
- Base: 7 HD force damage
- Special: 30-yard sweep; transforms struck objects randomly (weapons become snakes, armor becomes water, etc.)

**Iosyx's True Breath** (Mythical)
- Rolls: 24d6 (requires 6 exertion minimum)
- Required: 6
- Base: 20 HD fire damage
- Range: 200-yard line (yes, 200 yards)
- Special: Recharge after 4 rounds; this is the literal fire of creation and destruction combined. Everything flammable ignites; stone melts; water evaporates instantly. Creates permanent scar across landscape.

**Twin-Flame Rebirth** (Mythical) - Transformation
- Rolls: 20d6 (requires 5 exertion minimum)
- Required: 5
- Range: 100-yard radius
- Effect: Destroys all and creates anew. Every creature in range must make Resolve check (Mythical):
  - *Success:* Takes 10 HD fire damage, teleported 100 yards to safety
  - *Failure:* Reduced to 0 HD but transformed into creature of fire (HD becomes fire elemental form for 1 hour; retain consciousness but lose class abilities)

**Ignite the Faithful** (Ultimate, 6 only) - Command
- Rolls: 18d6 (requires 4 exertion minimum)
- Required: 5
- Range: 1 mile
- Effect: All fire within range becomes animated (each torch, campfire, brazier spawns 1 Ash Sprite or Cinderspawn under First Ember's control)

**Special Abilities:**
- **Legendary Resistance (4/day):** Can choose to succeed on any failed defense
- **Living Fire:** Does not take damage from fire; fire attacks heal First Ember for damage that would have been dealt
- **Chaos Resolve:** Resolve fluctuates—at start of each round, roll 1d6+4 for current Resolve
- **Cannot Die by Flame:** If reduced to 0 HD by fire damage, instead fully healed and enters rage (+4d6 to all attacks for 3 rounds)
- **Iosyx's Perfect Child:** Is considered Iosyx's direct presence for purposes of divine interaction; priests of Iosyx will not attack
- **Fire Teleportation:** As bonus action, teleport to any fire source within sight
- **The Twin Flames:** Embodies both creation and destruction. Once per day, can choose to either:
  - *Create:* Permanently create a new species of fire creature (GM determines)
  - *Destroy:* Permanently unmake one creature (no save; target erased from existence—only divine intervention restores)
- **Lair Action (Active in Lair):** At initiative count 20, one of:
  - All fires in lair intensify—creatures near fire take 4 HD damage
  - New fires erupt from ground in 6 random locations (10-yard radius each)
  - Temperature increases to lethal levels—creatures must make Fortitude check or take 3 HD damage and suffer Exhaustion

**Tactics:** Chaos incarnate—no predictable pattern. Opens with either Iosyx's True Breath or Ignite the Faithful depending on "mood." Uses Fire Teleportation constantly to reposition. May use Twin-Flame Rebirth as "greeting" or "finale." The First Ember has been known to stop mid-combat to create something beautiful, then immediately resume trying to destroy everything.

**Terrain/Environment:** The heart of the Roiling Crucible, the cores of stars, wherever the original fire of creation still burns. The First Ember's lair is literally inside a sun.

**Lore:** When Iosyx the Twin-Flame first roared creation and destruction into being, the first thing born from that cosmic fury was The First Ember. Part herald, part avatar, part child—the First Ember is Iosyx's will made manifest in draconic form. It embodies the paradox of Iosyx completely: it creates and destroys with equal abandon, sometimes in the same breath. Unlike other mythical creatures, the First Ember has a personality—mercurial, passionate, terrifying, but not evil. It treasures experiences, novelty, and change. Those who bore it die; those who fascinate it may receive gifts beyond mortal comprehension.

The First Ember's existence is why fire dragons exist at all—it is literally the first, the template, the burning prototype. Every Flame Wyrm carries a fraction of its essence. When the First Ember chooses (rarely), it can directly commune with any fire dragon across any distance, seeing through their eyes, speaking through their flames.

Encountering the First Ember is campaign-defining. Either you've done something to draw Iosyx's attention (good or bad), or cosmic-level change is imminent. The last recorded appearance presaged the Schism itself. Those who survive report dreams of fire for the rest of their lives—not nightmares, but visions of transformation, of what they could become if they dared to burn away who they were.

These NPCs represent inhabitants of the Mortal Weave who may aid the party temporarily, provide services, or join as companions during specific quests. They use the same mechanics as adversaries but are designed to support rather than oppose.

### Terrain & Environmental Combat

**The battlefield is never neutral.** Rangers master natural environments, Priests sanctify ground, and smart creatures use terrain as a weapon. Every encounter should consider:

#### Environmental Advantages

**Height Advantage:**
- Creatures on higher ground gain +1d6 to ranged attacks against lower targets
- Higher ground provides cover (+1d6 defense) against ranged attacks from below
- Example: Archers on cliff walls, Pall-Wolves stalking from ridge lines

**Cover & Concealment:**
- **Light Cover** (bushes, furniture): +1d6 to defense
- **Heavy Cover** (stone walls, thick trees): +2d6 to defense
- **Total Cover** (behind solid barrier): Cannot be targeted
- Rangers and rogues gain additional +1d6 when using natural cover (Favored Terrain feature)

**Difficult Terrain:**
- Movement costs double (5 yards movement crosses 2.5 yards of difficult terrain)
- Examples: Dense forest, rocky scree, deep water, icy surfaces
- Creatures native to terrain ignore this penalty (Verdant Guardians in forests, Pall-Wolves in Gloam-touched areas)
- Priests can sanctify ground to create difficult terrain for enemies only

**Hazardous Terrain:**
- Requires check to traverse safely
- Examples: Crumbling bridges, lava flows, thorn thickets, frozen rivers
- Failure typically deals 1-2 HD damage and ends movement
- Smart enemies drive opponents into hazards (Primal Wyrms knock foes into ravines)

#### Battlefield Features

**Chokepoints:**
- Narrow passages, doorways, bridge crossings
- Limit number of attackers (tactical advantage)
- Combatants with shield proficiency can hold chokepoints (+2d6 defense in narrow spaces)
- Example: Hold bridge against Verdant Creeper swarm

**Elevated Positions:**
- Towers, platforms, giant tree branches
- Grant sight and range advantage
- Require climbing or flight to reach (narrows approach vectors)
- Example: Moonbound Watchers atop ancient ruins

**Water Features:**
- Rivers, lakes, marshes, rain-slicked surfaces
- May impose movement penalties (unless creature is aquatic)
- River-Kin Guides and water-touched creatures gain advantage
- Can be blessed by Priests of Aluneth for +1d6 ally defense in water

**Lighting Conditions:**
- **Dim Light:** -1d6 to Awareness and ranged attacks (unless creature has darkvision)
- **Darkness:** -2d6 to attacks and Awareness (creatures with darkvision unaffected)
- **Bright Light:** Shadows flee, certain Gloam creatures take penalties
- Candlewights provide light; Mist Wisps extinguish it

**Elemental Hazards:**
- **Fire zones:** Deal 1-2 HD fire damage per round to creatures inside
- **Ice patches:** Require Agility checks or fall prone
- **Lightning storms:** Random lightning strikes (1d6 targets, 2 HD lightning damage)
- **Toxic gas/spores:** Deal 1 HD poison damage per round, may inflict conditions
- Flame Titans create fire zones naturally; Chaos Elementals warp environment unpredictably

#### Creature-Specific Terrain Use

**Verdant Guardians** (Forest Encounters):
- Create difficult terrain (entangling roots) as lair action
- Gain +2d6 defense when surrounded by plant life
- Can "step" between trees (bonus movement)
- Encounter design: Fight in old-growth forest with heavy canopy, limited sight lines

**Pall-Wolves** (Gloam-Touched Areas):
- Use darkness and mist for concealment (+2d6 stealth)
- Attack from elevated positions (hills, ruins)
- Hunt in packs with coordinated ambushes
- Encounter design: Twilight moors with scattered standing stones, vision limited to 20 yards

**Archon of the Halls** (Sacred Sites):
- Sanctified ground grants allies +1d6 to all rolls
- Broken oaths cause environmental backlash (1 HD psychic damage per round to oath-breakers)
- Concordant architecture never crumbles (total cover remains intact)
- Encounter design: Temple interior with pillars (cover), oath-inscribed floor

**Primal Wyrm** (Mountain/Wilderness):
- Uses Wing Buffet to knock enemies off cliffs (falling damage: 1 HD per 10 yards)
- Creates rockslides with roar (2 HD bludgeoning to 30-yard line)
- Nests in caves with narrow entrances (chokepoint favors Wyrm's size)
- Encounter design: Mountain ledge with steep drops, rock formations for cover

**Schism-Scarred Enforcer** (Urban/Ruins):
- Uses Chains to drag victims toward hazards
- Collapses weak structures (1-3 HD damage, creates difficult terrain)
- Environment "corrupts" over time—walls crack, shadows deepen
- Encounter design: Collapsing warehouse district with unstable floors, falling debris

**Memory Devourer** (Ancient Ruins):
- Erased zones become "forgotten space" (difficult terrain, characters become disoriented)
- Historical echoes manifest as temporal hazards (reliving battles, sudden environmental shifts)
- Can trap prey in memory loops (Resolve-based escape)
- Encounter design: Cyclopean library with shifting architecture, unreliable reality

#### Lair Actions

For major encounters (Expert+ creatures in their territory), use **Lair Actions** on initiative count 20 (losing ties):

**Example Lair Actions:**

**Verdant Domain** (Thymera-blessed forests):
- Roots erupt in 15-yard radius (difficult terrain + 1 HD piercing to creatures caught)
- Canopy closes (lighting drops to dim, advantage to defenders)
- Healing sap flows (forest creatures regain 1d6 HD)

**Gloam-Touched Ruins** (Aralys's domain):
- Shadows deepen (vision reduced to 10 yards, Gloam creatures gain +2d6 stealth)
- Ghostly whispers distract living (all living creatures must pass Resolve check or lose 1 action)
- Death-touched wind (deal 1 HD necrotic to all living creatures)

**Schism-Scarred Territory** (Azravael's corruption):
- Reality tears (10-yard zone warps; all inside roll defense or take 2 HD force damage)
- Chains erupt from ground (restrain random target, requires Expert 4+ Strength check to break)
- Contract bindings glow (creatures who've broken oaths take 1 HD psychic damage)

**River of Memory** (Aluneth's currents):
- Tidebound surge (water rises, creates difficult terrain, may knock prone)
- Memory flash (all creatures witness historical event; Resolve check or become stunned 1 round)
- Clear waters (all lies revealed, all invisible creatures become visible)

#### Rangers & Terrain Mastery

Rangers excel at environmental combat:
- **Favored Terrain:** Choose terrain type; party cannot be surprised there, Ranger has advantage on all checks
- **Natural Camouflage:** +2d6 stealth in wilderness
- **Tracker's Eye:** Can identify best tactical positions (grants allies environmental bonuses)
- **Wilderness Stride:** Ignore difficult terrain in natural environments

**Encounter Design for Rangers:**
- Use natural cover extensively (forests, rocky terrain)
- Include tracking or ambush opportunities
- Reward environmental awareness (hidden paths, safe crossings)
- Let Rangers prepare battlefield (set traps, identify hazards)

#### Priests & Sanctified Ground

Priests reshape sacred spaces:
- **Hallowed Ground:** 10-yard radius becomes difficult terrain for enemies, grants allies +1d6 defense
- **Sanctuary:** Designated zone prevents hostile actions (enemies must pass Resolve check to attack)
- **Divine Anchor:** Corrupted terrain can be cleansed (removes Schism taint, Gloam darkness)
- **Zone Control:** Priests excel at controlling specific battlefield areas

**Encounter Design for Priests:**
- Include desecrated sites to be reclaimed
- Use zone-based challenges (defend altar, hold temple threshold)
- Incorporate divine/infernal terrain conflicts
- Reward positioning and area control

#### Quick Environmental Encounter Checklist

When designing encounters, consider:

1. **Terrain Type:** Forest, mountain, urban, ruins, water, etc.
2. **Key Features:** Chokepoints, elevated positions, hazards, cover
3. **Lighting:** Bright, dim, darkness, shifting
4. **Movement:** Normal, difficult, hazardous, vertical elements
5. **Hazards:** Environmental damage sources, unstable structures
6. **Lair Actions:** Does major creature control environment?
7. **Class Synergy:** Does terrain favor party's Rangers/Priests/tactical specialists?

**Examples:**

**Forest Ambush** (favors Rangers and Verdant creatures):
- Heavy canopy (dim light)
- Dense undergrowth (difficult terrain, heavy cover)
- Ancient trees (climbing opportunities, elevated sniper positions)
- Babbling brook (water source for River-Kin, Priest blessings)

**Ruined Temple** (favors Priests and Oath creatures):
- Broken pillars (heavy cover, chokepoints between column rows)
- Sanctified altar (Hallowed Ground potential)
- Crumbling ceiling (hazard: falling stones 2 HD damage)
- Oath-inscribed floor (glows when lies spoken, Concordant Halls connection)

**Mountain Pass** (favors mobility and range):
- Narrow ledges (chokepoint, falling hazard 3-5 HD)
- Loose scree (difficult terrain, Agility check to avoid slide)
- Strong winds (-1d6 to ranged attacks)
- Elevated firing positions (height advantage for archers)

**Schism-Scarred Wasteland** (hostile to all):
- Reality tears (random 10-yard zones of warped space, 2 HD force damage)
- Ash storms (visibility reduced, -1d6 to attacks)
- Unstable ground (may collapse into void)
- No natural life (Rangers lose terrain advantage)

### Scaling Creatures

**To increase difficulty:**
- Add +2 HD per tier increase
- Add +1 Proficiency
- Add special ability
- Add Elite trait: +2d6 to one specific action type

**To decrease difficulty:**
- Remove -2 HD per tier decrease
- Remove special ability
- Reduce Proficiency by 1

### Cosmological Connections

Most creatures tie to specific deities or Custodial Powers:

**Concordant Halls:** Archons, Oath-Breaker Shades, Revenant Knights  
**Living Accord:** Verdant creatures, Primal Wyrms, Crownstags  
**Curator Arcanum:** Memory creatures, Threshold Walkers, Scholars  
**Azravael's Schism:** All Schism-Scarred, Death Knights, Heralds  
**Aralys's Gloam:** Moonbound, Pale Shepherds, Pall-Wolves  
**Iosyx's Chaos:** Elementals, Flame Titans, Chaos Fragments

Use these connections for narrative hooks and faction conflicts.
