## Understanding NPC Power Tiers

NPCs are categorized by their **Threat Tier**, which determines their overall power level and typical encounter difficulty:

| Tier | Description | Typical Level Equivalent | HD Range | Actions | Max Resolve |
|------|-------------|-------------------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Trivial** | Minimal threat, easily dispatched | Below Level 1 | 1-2 HD | 1 | 2 |
| **Basic** | Standard encounters for low-level parties | Level 1-2 | 3-5 HD | 1-2 | 2 |
| **Advanced** | Challenging foes for mid-level parties | Level 3-5 | 6-10 HD | 1-2 | 3 |
| **Expert** | Dangerous adversaries requiring tactics | Level 6-7 | 11-15 HD | 2 | 4 |
| **Legendary** | Epic threats, major story encounters | Level 8-9 | 16-20 HD | 2 + ½ party size (up) | 5+ |
| **Ultimate** | World-threatening entities | Level 10 | 21-25 HD | 2 + ½ party size (up) | 8+ |
| **Mythical** | Reality-warping cosmic forces | Beyond Level 10 | 26+ HD | 2 + party size (up) | 11+ |

**Note:** Higher-tier NPCs scale their action economy with party size to create epic, multi-phase encounters without becoming trivial or overwhelming.

---

## NPC Action Rules

**NPCs use simplified mechanics to reduce GM bookkeeping while maintaining the core dice pool system:**

### Fixed Dice Pools

**NPCs do NOT use exertion budgets.** Instead:
- Stat blocks show **total dice pools** for each action
- NPCs roll the listed dice pool every time (no exertion choices)
- **1s rolled by NPCs do NOT burn their HD** (no death spiral tracking)

**Example:**
```
Orc Raider (Proficiency 2)
- Greataxe Attack (Basic, 2+):
  - Rolls: 3d6 (always)
  - Required: 1
  - Base: 2 HD damage
```

The Orc always rolls 3d6 for this attack. No exertion decision, no HD burn from 1s.

---

### Reckless Aggression

Some NPCs can **temporarily increase their dice pools** under specific conditions:

**Reckless Trait Format:**
```
Special Abilities:
- Blood Rage: When below half HD, rolls 5d6 instead of 3d6 for Greataxe attacks
```

This represents desperate aggression without complex exertion tracking.

---

### NPC Actions Per Turn

NPCs get a different number of actions based on their Power Tier (see table above):

- **Trivial:** 1 action per turn
- **Basic-Advanced:** 1-2 actions per turn (GM's choice based on situation)
- **Expert:** 2 actions per turn
- **Legendary-Mythical:** 2+ actions (scales with party size for epic encounters)

**Why Variable Actions?**
- Solo bosses need more actions to challenge a full party
- Legendary+ threats feel like epic encounters, not just bigger HP bags
- Prevents action economy imbalance (4 PCs vs 1 boss)

**Action Tier Restrictions:**
- **All NPCs:** Only 1 action may be Expert tier or higher per turn
- **Legendary NPCs:** May use no more than 1 Legendary-tier action per round
- **Ultimate NPCs:** May use no more than 1 Ultimate-tier action per round
- **Mythical NPCs:** May use no more than 1 Mythical-tier action per round

These restrictions prevent NPCs from spamming their most powerful abilities and create dynamic, varied combat encounters.

**Triggered Actions & Held Actions:**
- NPCs can use triggered actions (reactions) if they haven't acted yet this round
- NPCs can hold actions, waiting for specific triggers
- If held action's trigger doesn't occur by round end, may only use for Basic tier actions

*See Game Master's Guide for complete NPC action economy rules.*

---

### NPC Resolve

NPCs have **variable Resolve** based on their tier:

- **Trivial-Basic:** Resolve 2 (easily demoralized)
- **Advanced:** Resolve 3 (moderate mental fortitude)
- **Expert:** Resolve 4 (disciplined)
- **Legendary:** Resolve 5+ (exceptional willpower)
- **Ultimate:** Resolve 8+ (supernatural conviction)
- **Mythical:** Resolve 11+ (reality-warping presence)

**Unlike player characters (who always have Resolve 5), NPCs scale to represent varying mental/spiritual strength.**

---

### NPC Defense Rolls

NPCs defend using the **same layered defense system as PCs:**

1. **Defense Capacity:** Proficiency
2. **Die Type:** Based on layer (magical barrier d12 → armor temp HD → permanent HD)
3. **No Exertion/Affinity:** NPCs cannot add bonus dice to defense
4. **1s on Defense:** Do NOT burn NPC HD (simplified bookkeeping)

**Example:**
```
Verdant Guardian (Proficiency 3, Armor 2d10 temp HD)
- Takes 4 HD damage from player attack
- Defense Capacity: Prof = 3 rolls
- Rolls: 3 separate 1d10 rolls (armor layer)
- Each success sustains 1 HD, each fail depletes 1 armor die
```

---

### Stat Block Dice Pool Explanation

When you see **"Rolls: 5d6"** in a stat block, this represents:
- The NPC's Proficiency dice (baseline competence)
- + Typical exertion (representing how aggressively they fight)
- = Fixed total (GM doesn't calculate each turn)

**The dice pool abstraction assumes NPCs fight at consistent aggression levels.** Proficiency dice and "exertion-equivalent" dice are combined into one simple roll.

---

### GM Tips for Running NPCs

**Keep It Simple:**
- Roll the dice shown in the stat block
- Don't track exertion budgets or HD burn from 1s
- Use "Reckless" traits for conditional power spikes

**Adjust Difficulty On-the-Fly:**
- If an NPC is too weak, describe them fighting more aggressively and add +1-2d6
- If too strong, describe exhaustion and reduce dice pool by 1-2d6
- Adjust HP mid-combat if needed (players never see your notes)

**Action Economy Tactics:**
- Legendary+ NPCs with multiple actions can split targets or perform combos
- Use extra actions narratively: "The dragon attacks, then breathes fire, then takes flight!"

**Resolve as Narrative Tool:**
- Low Resolve NPCs flee or surrender when bloodied
- High Resolve NPCs fight to the death or until objectives achieved
- Use Resolve damage from social encounters to demoralize enemies before combat

---

## NPC Stat Block Format

Each creature lists:
- **Threat Tier:** Power category (determines Actions and Max Resolve)
- **HD Pool:** Total Hit Dice (die type and count)
- **Proficiency:** Based on effective level
- **Resolve:** Mental/spiritual fortitude (varies by tier, see table above)
- **Armor:** Natural or worn armor (temp HD)
- **Movement:** Base movement speed
- **Attacks:** Name, tier, fixed dice pool, required successes, base damage
- **Special Abilities:** Unique powers or traits (including Reckless traits)
- **Tactics:** How they fight or behave
- **Terrain/Environment (optional):** Preferred terrain and how they use it tactically
- **Lore:** Connection to cosmology and narrative hooks

**Remember:** Dice pools shown are fixed totals (Proficiency + typical aggression). NPCs don't make exertion choices or burn HD from 1s—roll the dice shown and move on!

**Note:** Not all creatures have specific terrain preferences, but those that do gain significant tactical advantages in their native environments. Rangers, Priests, and environmental specialists should leverage or counter these advantages.

---

## Trivial Tier Creatures

*Minimal threats, easily overcome by even level 1 characters*

---

### Mist Wisp
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 1d4  
**Proficiency:** 0 (rolls 1d6 on all actions)  
**Resolve:** 1  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** Fly 15 yards (hover)  

**Chilling Touch** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 1d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD cold damage (touch range)

**Special Abilities:**
- **Incorporeal:** Physical weapons pass through unless magical or blessed
- **Light Sensitivity:** Takes +1 HD damage from radiant sources

**Tactics:** Drifts aimlessly, only attacking when disturbed. Flees after taking any damage.

**Terrain/Environment:** Most common near Threshold Zones where the Gloam bleeds through, or in areas where the Hollow Mourning State has left its mark. Abandoned villages, forgotten battlefields, places where even grief has faded to nothing.

**Lore:** Fragments of memory from the Gloam that have seeped through planar boundaries, born during Hollow-tides when mourning forgets what it mourned. They seek warmth and life, draining it instinctively—not from malice, but from a desperate, wordless need to remember what being alive felt like. Associated with souls who slipped past the Pale Shepherds during the Hollow. The Moonbound Choir considers them cautionary tales: this is what happens when grief is never resolved. A Mist Wisp cannot be reasoned with because there is nothing left inside to reason with.

---

### Scrap Imp
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 2d4  
**Proficiency:** 0  
**Resolve:** 1  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** 10 yards, climb 10 yards  

**Bite** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 1d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD piercing damage

**Special Abilities:**
- **Scavenger:** Can consume metal objects (coins, nails, etc.) to restore 1 HD
- **Cowardly:** Flees if reduced below half HD

**Tactics:** Sneaks into camps to steal metal objects. Bites if cornered but runs immediately after.

**Lore:** Minor construct-spirits born from discarded metal and the Curator Arcanum's overflow of knowledge. Not malicious, just hungry and mischievous. Common in cities and workshops.

---

### Candlewight
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 1d6  
**Proficiency:** 1  
**Resolve:** 1  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** Fly 10 yards (hover)  

**Searing Touch** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 1d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD fire damage

**Special Abilities:**
- **Living Flame:** Sheds light 10 yards, can ignite flammable objects
- **Snuff:** Dies immediately if exposed to strong wind or water

**Tactics:** Hovers near travelers, drawn to loneliness and sorrow. Not inherently hostile but burns if touched. Follows grieving travelers for miles, offering light without words.

**Terrain/Environment:** Appears during Remembrance Mourning States, near deathbeds, and in places where someone died alone but remembered. Most common at crossroads and inn hearths after midnight. Occasionally drifts through the Mortal Weave where the Gloam's influence thins.

**Lore:** Spirits from the Gloam born during Remembrance—the Mourning State when grief still honors what was lost. Each Candlewight is the last flicker of hope from a dying soul, sent by Balemor the Hearth-Walker to comfort those who grieve. They appear as floating candle flames with soft, mournful light, and their presence means someone nearby needs comfort. The Pale Shepherds recognize them as allies; during Release, Candlewights often guide souls toward their final passage. Unlike Grief-Lanterns (which feed on sorrow), Candlewights ease it. Those who treat them gently report dreams of closure. Those who extinguish them carelessly sometimes find their own hope harder to kindle.

---

### River Minnow Swarm
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 2d6 (swarm acts as single entity)  
**Proficiency:** 0  
**Resolve:** 0

**Special Abilities:**
- **Swarm:** Takes half damage from single-target attacks
- **Water-Bound:** Dies if removed from water for more than 1 round

**Tactics:** Swarms creatures bleeding in water. Disperses if reduced below half HD.

**Lore:** Mundane fish touched by Aluneth's memory currents. They remember ancient predators and attack anything that smells of blood. River-Kin sometimes guide them away from travelers.

---

### Ash Sprite
**Threat Tier:** Trivial  
**HD Pool:** 1d4  
**Proficiency:** 0  
**Resolve:** 1  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** 15 yards, fly 15 yards  

**Ember Burst** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 1d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD fire damage (5-yard radius, self-destructs)

**Special Abilities:**
- **Explosive Death:** When reduced to 0 HD, automatically triggers Ember Burst

**Tactics:** Floats near campfires and forges. If startled, panics and explodes.

**Lore:** Tiny elementals born from the Primal Flame, touched by Iosyx the Twin-Flame's chaos. They're not malicious—just unstable and easily frightened. Scholars debate whether they're alive or merely animated ash.

---

## Basic Tier Creatures

*Standard encounters for low-level parties (Level 1-2)*

---

- **Pack Tactics:** +1d6 to attacks if ally is within 5 yards of target

**Tactics:** Hunts in packs of 2-4. Uses Shadowy Lunge on weakest target, then standard bites. Flees if pack reduced to 1.

**Terrain/Environment:** Gloam-touched moors, forests at twilight, misty valleys. Gains +2d6 to stealth in total darkness or heavy fog. Uses elevated positions (hills, rock formations) for ambush. Avoids direct sunlight (-1d6 to all actions in bright light). Pack coordinates to drive prey into difficult terrain (thick undergrowth, fog banks) where vision is limited.

**Lore:** Wolves from the Gloam, touched by perpetual darkness. Their fur seems to drink light, and their eyes glow pale silver. They hunt the boundary between Mortal Weave and Gloam, preying on travelers who stray too close to Threshold Zones. Thalos permits their existence as reminders of consequence.

---

### Oath-Breaker Shade
**Threat Tier:** Basic  
**HD Pool:** 3d6

**Tactics:** Targets those who have broken oaths, whispering their failures. Flees from those with strong conviction (Resolve 3+).

**Lore:** These are echoes of those who died with broken oaths, rejected by both the Concordant Halls and Aralys's mercy. They exist in torment, seeking to drag others into their guilt. The Hollow Vespers sometimes command them. Can only be truly destroyed by fulfilling the oath they broke in life.

---

### Vigil Shade
**Threat Tier:** Basic  
**HD Pool:** 4d6  
**Proficiency:** 1  
**Resolve:** 3  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** 10 yards  

**Denial Strike** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 2d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD psychic damage
- Special: Target must succeed on Resolve check or forget they were damaged (cannot tell how much HD they've lost until combat ends)

**Loop the Moment** (Advanced, 3+)
- Rolls: 3d6
- Required: 2
- Range: 15 yards
- Effect: Target is forced to repeat last action taken (whether successful or not). If they cannot repeat it (moved out of range, target gone), they lose their action entirely

**Special Abilities:**
- **Denial State:** Cannot be convinced it is dead. If reduced to 0 HD, reforms at sundown unless laid to rest with proper funeral rites
- **Vigil-Born:** Appears only during Vigil-tides in the Gloam or when someone refuses to accept a recent death
- **Familiar Face:** Appears as someone target has lost—a parent, friend, or comrade recently dead

**Tactics:** Doesn't understand it's fighting. Repeats last moments of its life endlessly. Attacks only those who interfere with its loop for anyone who forces it to acknowledge death.

**Terrain/Environment:** Appears at fresh graves, deathbeds, battlefield sites within days of a death. Most common during the Vigil Mourning State. Mist follows it. Time feels slower nearby.

**Lore:** When the Gloam's Vigil dominates a region, the recently dead sometimes fail to realize they've died. These Vigil Shades walk through their last moments in an infinite loop—eating breakfast, walking to market, dying, waking, eating breakfast again. They aren't hostile unless forced to confront reality. Wise travelers let them pass. Those who force closure too roughly may face a shade's desperate rage. The Pale Shepherds gently guide Vigil Shades toward Release when Remembrance arrives.

---

### Grief-Lantern
**Threat Tier:** Basic  
**HD Pool:** 3d8  
**Proficiency:** 2  
**Resolve:** 2  
**Armor:** None (incorporeal)  
**Movement:** Fly 15 yards (hover)  

**Sorrowlight** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 3d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD psychic damage
- Range: 20 yards
- Special: Target sees brief vision of someone they've lost

**Grief Beacon** (Advanced, 3+) - Environmental
- Rolls: 4d6
- Required: 2
- Effect: 15-yard radius fills with pale light. All living creatures within must make Resolve check or suffer -1d6 to all actions as grief weighs on them (lasts while in light)

**Special Abilities:**
- **Incorporeal:** Physical attacks pass through unless magical or blessed
- **Mourner's Light:** Sheds pale, cold light in 20-yard radius. Undead within this light gain +1d6 to all actions
- **Feed on Sorrow:** Heals 1 HD whenever creature within 15 yards fails Resolve check

**Tactics:** Drifts silently, following those carrying grief. Uses Grief Beacon to weaken groups, then Sorrowlight on those who show emotional vulnerability.

**Terrain/Environment:** Floats above cemeteries, memorial sites, and places of recent tragedy. Common during Remembrance Mourning State but can appear anywhere death has touched.

**Lore:** Unlike Candlewights (which offer comfort), Grief-Lanterns are parasites that feed on unprocessed sorrow. They're believed to be stillborn Candlewights—comfort that never arrived, curdled into hunger. Balemor the Hearth-Walker is said to weep when he sees what his failed blessings become. The light they shed is beautiful but cold, and many travelers mistake them for guides before realizing the lantern leads only deeper into grief.

---

### Hollow Drifter
**Threat Tier:** Basic  
**HD Pool:** 5d6  
**Proficiency:** 2  
**Resolve:** 0 (cannot be reduced; has no will to break)  
**Armor:** None  
**Movement:** 10 yards, phase through obstacles  

**Identity Drain** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 3d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 1 HD necrotic damage
- Special: Target must make Resolve check or forget their own name for 1 hour (cannot use class abilities tied to identity until remembered)

**Emptiness Touch** (Advanced, 3+)
- Rolls: 4d6
- Required: 2
- Targets Resolve
- Range: Touch
- Effect: 2 Resolve damage. If target reaches 0 Resolve, they become apathetic and cannot willingly act for 1d6 rounds

**Special Abilities:**
- **Hollow-Born:** Created when Hollow Mourning State strips identity from wandering souls
- **Faceless:** Has no face—just smoothed, featureless skin. Immune to effects requiring eye contact
- **Memory Null:** Creatures cannot remember Drifter's location if they look away. Must make Awareness check to track it
- **Hunger for Self:** Drawn to those with strong identities (high Resolve, defined goals)

**Tactics:** Drifts toward sources of identity and purpose. Attacks mechanically, without malice—it doesn't remember what malice is. Prioritizes targets with highest Resolve.

**Terrain/Environment:** Appears during Hollow Mourning States, or in places where mass forgetting has occurred (destroyed libraries, massacred villages with no survivors to remember). The air feels empty where they drift.

**Lore:** The Hollow is the Gloam's most dangerous Mourning State—grief that has curdled into emptiness, mourning that forgot what it mourned. Hollow Drifters are what remains of souls caught in the Hollow too long. They've forgotten everything: name, face, purpose, even the memory of having memories. They drift through the Gloam seeking what they lost, draining identity from others in vain hope of recovering their own. The Pale Shepherds can guide many souls, but Hollow Drifters are beyond even their reach—there's nothing left to guide.

---

### Verdant Creeper
**Threat Tier:** Basic  
**HD Pool:** 5d8  
**Proficiency:** 1  
**Resolve:** 1

- Required: 1
- Base: 2 HD slashing damage
- Range: 10 yards (vine reach)

**Entangling Roots** (Advanced, 3+)
- Rolls: 3d6
- Required: 2
- Effect: Target within 10 yards is grappled (immobilized until they succeed on Fortitude skill roll, requires action)
- Does not deal damage

**Special Abilities:**
- **Rooted Resilience:** +2d6 to defend against forced movement while rooted
- **Photosynthesis:** Regains 1 HD per round in direct sunlight

**Tactics:** Waits in ambush near paths. Entangles strongest-looking target, then focuses Thorned Lash on casters. Flees underground if reduced below half HD.

**Lore:** Plant creatures animated by the Living Accord's overflow of growth energy. They defend ancient forests and sacred groves, attacking those who harm nature. Thymera's priests can speak with them and negotiate safe passage. Not evil, but protective and territorial.

---

### Bloom-Spawn
**Threat Tier:** Basic  
**HD Pool:** 4d8  
**Proficiency:** 1  
**Resolve:** 1  
**Armor:** Petal layers (1d8 temp HD)  
**Movement:** 10 yards  

**Thorn Spray** (Basic, 2+)
- Rolls: 2d6
- Required: 1
- Base: 2 HD piercing damage
- Range: 15 yards (all creatures in 5-yard cone)

**Proliferate** (Advanced, 3+)
- Rolls: 3d6
- Required: 2

- **Bloom-Touched:** During Bloom dominance in the Verdant Verge, gains +2d6 to all actions and unlimited Seedlings
- **Beautiful Danger:** First time a creature sees a Bloom-Spawn, must make Awareness check (Basic, 2+) or approach without hostility (entranced by beauty)

**Tactics:** Creates Seedlings to swarm enemies, uses Thorn Spray on grouped targets. Retreats toward sunlight if damaged. Does not pursue into darkness.

**Terrain/Environment:** Appears in areas where the Bloom Excess is ascendant—meadows choked with flowers, forests where growth outpaces decay. Common near threshold zones where Verdant Verge bleeds into Mortal Weave.

**Lore:** When the Bloom dominates the Verdant Verge, its ideology (*Growth must not slow*) spawns living avatars. Bloom-Spawn are walking gardens of impossible beauty, flowers emerging from humanoid shapes made of vine and nectar. They aren't hostile by nature—they simply proliferate, filling spaces with growth, treating other creatures as substrate for more Bloom. What they create is beautiful. What they replace is gone forever. The Verdant Synod attempts to moderate Bloom-Spawn, but during Bloom-tides, they proliferate faster than they can be culled.

**HD Pool:** 5d8

- **Graceful Decay:** When reduced to 0 HD, releases cloud of spores in 10-yard radius. Creatures must make Fortitude check or suffer -1d6 to next action (drowsy, ready to sleep).
- **Withering-Touched:** During Withering dominance in the Verdant Verge, gains +2d6 defense (harvest cannot be stopped)

**Tactics:** Approaches slowly, gesturing for prey to accept their time. Uses Harvest Scythe on weakened targets. Does not chase those who flee—they'll ripen eventually.

**Terrain/Environment:** Orchards where fruit falls endlessly, forests blanketed in autumn gold even in summer, fields of grain bowed heavy with seed. The Withering is not winter—it's the necessary maturation before rest.

**Lore:** Sentient expressions of the Withering Excess, these figures appear as orchard-ghosts wrapped in falling leaves and the scent of ripe fruit. They aren't death-bringers—they're harvesters. Their ideology (*All beauty must mature and fall*) makes them patient, accepting, even kind. A Withering Herald will warn travelers: "Your time approaches. Use it well." They become dangerous only when the Bloom grows too aggressive, racing to restore balance by forcing premature harvest. During Withering-tides, they walk in procession, bringing autumn wherever they go.

**Lore:** Created by Thymera the Verdant-Mother to defend the Living Accord's most sacred spaces. They're not constructs but living extensions of the forest itself—ancient trees given mobility and purpose. Can communicate with druids and rangers through rustling leaves and root tremors.

They exist in tormented limbo, driven only by need to complete their final promise.

Accept offerings of memory (stories, songs, tributes to the dead).

### Primal Wyrm
**Threat Tier:** Expert  
**HD Pool:** 15d12  
**Proficiency:** 4  
**Resolve:** 3  
**Armor:** Scales (2d12 temp HD)  
**Movement:** 15 yards, fly 30 yards, burrow 10 yards  

**Devastating Bite** (Expert, 4+)
- Rolls: 8d6 (requires 1 exertion minimum)

**Primal Breath** (Legendary, 5+)
- Rolls: 10d6 (requires 2 exertion minimum)
- Required: 3
- Base: 5 HD elemental damage (type depends on wyrm's environment: fire, cold, lightning, or acid)

- Special: Ignites/freezes/electrifies terrain (creates difficult terrain)

**Coil and Crush** (Expert, 4+)
- Rolls: 8d6
- Required: 3
- Base: 4 HD bludgeoning damage to grappled target
- Special: Automatically succeeds if target is already grappled

**Wing Buffet** (Advanced, 3+)

- **Living Accord's Fury:** Embodies raw nature; Resistance to one element depending on environment
- **Legendary Resilience:** Can reroll failed defense once per round
- **Keen Senses:** +3d6 to Awareness checks

**Tactics:** Opens with Frightful Presence, then Primal Breath on groups. Uses Devastating Bite to grapple strongest warrior, then Coil and Crush. Wing Buffet to knock back swarming enemies. Flees to lair if reduced below 1/3 HD.

**Terrain/Environment:** Mountain peaks, deep canyons, wild coastlines—anywhere primal nature dominates. Uses flight to maintain positional advantage (elevated attacks gain +1d6). Wing Buffet near cliff edges to knock enemies off (falling damage 1 HD per 10 yards). Breath weapon shapes terrain (fire breath creates burning zones dealing 1 HD/round, ice breath creates difficult terrain, etc.). Can burrow to create ambush opportunities or escape underground. Lair is typically cave system with narrow entrance (chokepoint) and multiple vertical levels. Creates rockslides with roar (2 HD bludgeoning in 30-yard line). Wyrms claiming coastal territories use tidal patterns tactically.

**Lore:** Ancient draconic creatures born from the Living Accord's primal energies. Not true dragons but their lesser cousins—powerful but mortal. They claim territories (mountains, forests, swamps) and defend them jealously. Each wyrm embodies its environment's elemental nature. Thymera and Darthun both claim dominion over them, causing theological debates among druids. Can live for centuries and accumulate vast knowledge. Some serve as guardians of sacred groves; others as destructive forces. Can be bargained with if offering is significant (ancient knowledge, rare treasures, or promises of protection).

### Sorrow Leech
**Threat Tier:** Expert  
**HD Pool:** 10d8  
**Proficiency:** 4  
**Resolve:** 2  
**Armor:** Ethereal hide (2d8 temp HD)  
**Movement:** Fly 15 yards (hover), phasing  

**Psychic Drain** (Expert, 4+)
- Rolls: 8d6 (requires 1 exertion minimum)
- Required: 3
- Base: 3 HD psychic damage
- Range: 15 yards
- Special: Leech heals HD equal to damage dealt

**Amplify Grief** (Legendary, 5+) - Social Attack
- Rolls: 10d6 (requires 2 exertion minimum)
- Required: 3
- Targets Resolve of all enemies within 20 yards
- Base: 2 Resolve damage to each
- Special: Target painful memories; creatures with tragic backstories take 3 Resolve damage instead

**Possession** (Legendary, 5+)
- Rolls: 9d6 (requires 3 exertion minimum)
- Required: 3
- Targets Resolve
- Range: Touch
- Effect: Enter target's body. Target must make Resolve check (Legendary, 5+, requires 3 successes) each round or remain possessed. While possessed, Leech controls actions but takes half any damage target receives

**Special Abilities:**
- **Ethereal:** Incorporeal; physical attacks pass through unless magical
- **Emotion Sense:** Can detect strong emotions (grief, guilt, despair) within 60 yards
- **Invisible:** Naturally invisible; requires Awareness (Expert, 4+) to detect
- **Vulnerability (Radiant):** Takes double damage from radiant

**Tactics:** Remains invisible, using Amplify Grief to weaken groups. Possesses target with lowest Resolve. Flees into ethereal plane if threatened.

**Terrain/Environment:** Most active during Remembrance and Vigil Mourning States. Drawn to funerals, battlefields, deathbeds, and memorials. Avoids areas in Release (nothing left to feed on) and flees from the Hollow (even parasite needs prey with something to drain). Follows the grief-heavy, sometimes for weeks.

**Lore:** Parasitic entities from the Gloam that feed on sorrow and grief. Unlike Hollow Vespers (which *create* despair), Sorrow Leeches merely consume it—filling an ecological niche within the Gloam's emotional weather. During Vigil, they gorge on denial; during Remembrance, they feast on active mourning. They're most dangerous when the Gloam's grief accumulates faster than it can process, and Sorrow Leeches multiply to consume the excess.

Not inherently evil—they're predators, and predators serve functions. Balemor the Hearth-Walker tolerates them because grief that festers too long becomes the Hollow, and Hollow Drifters cannot be saved. Better a Sorrow Leech drain your sorrow than let it consume you entirely. The Pale Shepherds sometimes *guide* grieving souls toward Sorrow Leeches when grief threatens to trap them in Vigil forever—a painful mercy.

Can be driven away by celebrations of life and strong community bonds. Priests of Ilyra ward against them with hearthstone charms. The Moonbound Choir regards them as necessary evils, distasteful but part of the Gloam's balance.

**Lore:** Primordial beings born in volcanic cores where Iosyx's chaos meets earthly fire. They're not elementals but living embodiments of transformation through flame. Most slumber for centuries, waking only when volcanic activity surges. Some cultures worship them as gods of renewal (fire clears the old for new growth). Can be reasoned with by those bearing Iosyx's mark or offering rare minerals (diamonds, rubies) which they consume. Each Titan has unique personality—some benevolent, others destructive.

**Lore:** Aberrations that feed on memories, stealing them permanently. Unlike Memory Echoes (which replay memories), Devourers consume them—erasing events from victim's mind. They're violations of Aluneth's domain, and she has placed bounties on them. Each Devourer appears different based on memories consumed—shifting form reflects stolen identities. Can be found near libraries, elder councils, or ancient battlefields. Destroying one releases some memories (GM can return one significant memory to party member). Rumored to be created by Velkir the Ash-Tongued as weapons against history itself.

**Tactics:** Opens with Infernal Presence to terrify enemies. Uses Chains of Azravael on primary threat, then Ruinous Blade on others. Calls reinforcements if outnumbered. Offers contracts to weakened foes ("Your soul for your life").

**Lore:** Champions of Azravael who have fully embraced the Schism. They were once heroes who made desperate bargains and now enforce Azravael's contracts across realms. Each remembers their former life and the moment they fell—some regret it, others embrace damnation. Bear titles like "Knight of Broken Oaths" or "Enforcer of Eternal Debt." Can only be permanently destroyed if their original contract is somehow voided (nearly impossible). The Concordant Halls considers them abominations—oath-wielders turned against the very concept of honor.

They guard the most sacred thresholds and oath-sites. Can speak all languages and prefer diplomacy to violence—only fight when oaths are violated. Each Drake has a specific domain (Justice, Memory, Protection, etc.). Slaying one without just cause brings the wrath of the entire Concordant Halls.

**Lore:** Elite psychopomps elevated by Aralys herself to handle the most complex soul passages. They appear as tall figures in flowing robes with faces hidden behind pale masks. Each carries staff crowned with symbol of the moon. They guide heroes, monarchs, and those whose deaths carry cosmic weight. Can be encountered at major story moments (death of kings, apocalyptic battles, etc.). Speaking with one is said to change a person—you see your own death reflected in their mask. Not enemies unless you actively prevent death's natural course (lichdom, true resurrection, etc.).

**Lore:** Ancient trees given mobility and consciousness by Thymera millennia ago to defend the most sacred groves. Each is unique—personality shaped by centuries of observation. Some are gentle gardeners; others wrathful defenders. They speak in slow, creaking voices like old wood settling and consider decades like mortals consider hours. Destroying one is cosmic-level crime against nature—Thymera herself may manifest to punish slayers. However, Colossi respect worthy opponents and may yield if given reason (druidic entreaty, oath of protection, etc.). Their heartwood is most potent magical component in existence—worth kingdoms but guarded by all nature.

Each Herald was once a mortal king, hero, or saint who made the ultimate bargain. They appear as towering figures in ornate infernal armor, faces hidden behind masks of contract-signed bone. They speak in perfect legalese, every word binding. Can negotiate—all Heralds seek souls for Azravael's engine. Defeating one requires either military might (level 10 party), divine intervention, or finding loophole in the Herald's own binding contract. If destroyed, returns after 99 years unless original contract voided.

- **Deathless:** Cannot be reduced below 1 HD by any means
- **Ethereal Form:** Can become incorporeal at will
- **Psychopomp Authority:** +5d6 to all checks involving death, mercy, or judgment
- **Remember All:** Knows true name and death of every mortal ever lived

**Tactics:** Does not seek combat—appears only when cosmic balance of death is threatened (mass lichdom, true resurrection abuse, etc.). If forced to fight, uses Moonlight Cascade to cleanse undead, then Veil Between to show mortals their fate. Touch of Mercy only for those truly suffering.

**Lore:** Aralys rarely manifests directly, but when death's natural order faces existential threat, she sends an Aspect—fragment of her consciousness given form. Aspects appear as beautiful figures shrouded in moonlight with eyes that reflect your death. They speak gently but with absolute authority. Cannot be defeated through violence (Deathless ability) but can be reasoned with. If you face an Aspect, someone has violated death's sanctity on cosmic scale. Aspects have granted mercy to heroes who convinced them their cause was just. Each encounter with an Aspect changes you forever—you've looked into death itself and seen mercy waiting.

## Mythical Tier Creatures

*Reality-warping cosmic forces (Beyond Level 10)*

---

### Fragment of Iosyx
**Threat Tier:** Mythical  
**HD Pool:** 25d20  
**Proficiency:** 6  
**Resolve:** 4 (constantly fluctuates)  
**Armor:** Chaotic form (2d20 temp HD, changes element/type each round)  
**Movement:** Variable (roll 1d20 for yards per round), fly, teleport, irregular  

**Chaos Incarnate** (Mythical, variable)
- Rolls: 16d6
- Required: Roll 1d6 to determine (changes each use)
- Base: 8 HD damage (type changes each round: fire, cold, lightning, acid, force, psychic)
- Range: Variable (roll 1d100 for yards)
- Special: Effect changes each use (consult Chaos Table)

**Reality Flux** (Ultimate, 6 only) - Environmental/Reality
- Rolls: 18d6 (requires 3 exertion minimum)
- Required: 4
- Range: 100-yard radius

  1. Gravity reverses
  2. All magic suppressed
  3. All creatures swap positions randomly
  4. Time dilates (extra round for all)
  5. Elements invert (fire becomes cold, etc.)
  6. All weapons become flowers
  7. Physical laws suspend (flight without wings, walk through walls)
  8. All creatures speak unknown language
  9. Emotions made visible (auras of feeling)
  10. Roll twice, combine effects

**Transformation Wave** (Mythical)
- Rolls: 20d6 (requires 3 exertion minimum)
- Required: 4
- Range: 50-yard cone
- Effect: All in area must make Resolve check (Ultimate, 6 only) or be transformed into random creature (GM determines, lasts 1 hour)

**Twin-Flame Rebirth** (Special) - Passive
- When reduced to 0 HD, explodes in reality-shaking burst (10 HD force damage to all within 50 yards)
- Immediately reforms elsewhere in world (random location)
- Cannot be permanently destroyed

**Special Abilities:**
- **Cosmic Chaos:** Immune to all attempts to predict, bind, or control
- **Elemental Omnibus:** Immune to all elemental damage and can change to any element at will
- **Reality Slip:** Automatically succeeds on all defense rolls on natural 6
- **Iosyx's Nature:** Embodies cosmic change; alters local physics just by existing
- **The Twin Flames:** Simultaneously creates and destroys; all damage dealt also heals Fragment by same amount

**Tactics:** No tactics—pure chaos. Attacks random targets with random abilities. Reality Flux spontaneously when "interested" (GM discretion). Transformation Wave for "fun."

**Lore:** Not Iosyx herself but a fragment shed during a moment of extreme cosmic change (creation of a star, birth of new realm, etc.). Fragments "exist" only loosely—they're more concepts given temporary form. Encountering one is catastrophic event remembered for generations. They don't "want" anything—they simply ARE change. Cannot be reasoned with or bargained with. Only "defeated" by channeling into controlled change (transform into something stable) or waiting until Fragment's energy dissipates naturally (days or weeks of chaos). Some cults worship Fragment appearance as sign of coming transformation. Scholars who survive encounter sometimes gain insight into fundamental nature of reality.

### The Tidebound Memory (Aluneth's Echo)
**Threat Tier:** Mythical  
**HD Pool:** 28d12  
**Proficiency:** 7  
**Resolve:** 10 (cannot be reduced)

- Required: 6
- Targets Resolve of all creatures within 60 yards
- Base: 2 Resolve damage
- Special: Creatures reduced to 0 Resolve by this ability forget who they are (lose all class abilities, memories, personality). Effect is permanent unless memory is restored through quest/ritual

**Memory Flood** (Ultimate, 6 only)
- Rolls: 16d6
- Required: 4
- Range: 40-yard cone
- Effect: Overwhelm targets with all memories stored in local water (centuries of events). Creatures must make Resolve check (Ultimate, 6 only) or collapse unconscious for 1d4 hours

**Aluneth's Judgment** (Mythical) - Reality/Social
- Rolls: 20d6
- Required: 4
- Range: 100 yards
- Effect: Echo speaks truth of target's past aloud (reveals all secrets, all forgotten moments, all lies). Target must make Resolve check (Mythical) or suffer existential crisis (Resolve reduced to 0, see Tide of Forgetting)

**Rewrite History** (Mythical) - Ultimate Power
- Requires 3 rounds of concentration
- Range: Touch
- Effect: Alter one specific memory in target's mind permanently. Can add, remove, or change any event. Only Aluneth herself can reverse this

- Cannot be killed while near water (any source: puddle, river, ocean)

- **Psychic Immunity:** Cannot be mentally influenced, charmed, or deceived
- **Truthsense:** Automatically knows when someone lies

**Tactics:** Does not seek combat—appears when someone attempts to erase history or rewrite collective memory. First uses Memory Flood to show truth, then Aluneth's Judgment to force accountability. Rewrite History only in most extreme cases (usually to undo damage done by others). Tide of Forgetting as Last resort against those who refuse to accept truth.

**Lore:** Appears when Aluneth herself manifests concern over historical revisionism, mass memory erasure, or attempt to unmake events. Looks like figure made of flowing water shaped by all memories held within—constantly shifting to show different historical moments. Speaks in chorus of voices (all who contributed to these memories). Cannot lie and forces truth upon world. Encountering Echo means you're part of event so significant it will be remembered eternally. Scholars debate whether Echo is Aluneth herself or merely her strongest manifestation. Either way, it represents infinite weight of history made manifest. Can be "reasoned" with only by accepting truth and committing to preserve memory.

These NPCs represent inhabitants of the Mortal Weave who may aid the party temporarily, provide services, or join as companions during specific quests. They use the same mechanics as adversaries but are designed to support rather than oppose.

### Terrain & Environmental Combat

**The battlefield is never neutral.** Rangers master natural environments, Priests sanctify ground, and smart creatures use terrain as a weapon. Every encounter should consider:

#### Environmental Advantages

**Height Advantage:**
- Creatures on higher ground gain +1d6 to ranged attacks against lower targets
- Higher ground provides cover (+1d6 defense) against ranged attacks from below
- Example: Archers on cliff walls, Pall-Wolves stalking from ridge lines

**Cover & Concealment:**
- **Light Cover** (bushes, furniture): +1d6 to defense
- **Heavy Cover** (stone walls, thick trees): +2d6 to defense
- **Total Cover** (behind solid barrier): Cannot be targeted
- Rangers and rogues gain additional +1d6 when using natural cover (Favored Terrain feature)

**Difficult Terrain:**
- Movement costs double (5 yards movement crosses 2.5 yards of difficult terrain)
- Examples: Dense forest, rocky scree, deep water, icy surfaces
- Creatures native to terrain ignore this penalty (Verdant Guardians in forests, Pall-Wolves in Gloam-touched areas)
- Priests can sanctify ground to create difficult terrain for enemies only

**Hazardous Terrain:**
- Requires check to traverse safely
- Examples: Crumbling bridges, lava flows, thorn thickets, frozen rivers
- Failure typically deals 1-2 HD damage and ends movement
- Smart enemies drive opponents into hazards (Primal Wyrms knock foes into ravines)

#### Battlefield Features

**Chokepoints:**
- Narrow passages, doorways, bridge crossings
- Limit number of attackers (tactical advantage)
- Combatants with shield proficiency can hold chokepoints (+2d6 defense in narrow spaces)
- Example: Hold bridge against Verdant Creeper swarm

**Elevated Positions:**
- Towers, platforms, giant tree branches
- Grant sight and range advantage
- Require climbing or flight to reach (narrows approach vectors)
- Example: Moonbound Watchers atop ancient ruins

**Water Features:**
- Rivers, lakes, marshes, rain-slicked surfaces
- May impose movement penalties (unless creature is aquatic)
- River-Kin Guides and water-touched creatures gain advantage
- Can be blessed by Priests of Aluneth for +1d6 ally defense in water

**Lighting Conditions:**
- **Dim Light:** -1d6 to Awareness and ranged attacks (unless creature has darkvision)
- **Darkness:** -2d6 to attacks and Awareness (creatures with darkvision unaffected)
- **Bright Light:** Shadows flee, certain Gloam creatures take penalties
- Candlewights provide light; Mist Wisps extinguish it

**Elemental Hazards:**
- **Fire zones:** Deal 1-2 HD fire damage per round to creatures inside
- **Ice patches:** Require Agility checks or fall prone
- **Lightning storms:** Random lightning strikes (1d6 targets, 2 HD lightning damage)
- **Toxic gas/spores:** Deal 1 HD poison damage per round, may inflict conditions
- Flame Titans create fire zones naturally; Chaos Elementals warp environment unpredictably

#### Creature-Specific Terrain Use

**Verdant Guardians** (Forest Encounters):
- Create difficult terrain (entangling roots) as lair action
- Gain +2d6 defense when surrounded by plant life
- Can "step" between trees (bonus movement)
- Encounter design: Fight in old-growth forest with heavy canopy, limited sight lines

**Primal Wyrm** (Mountain/Wilderness):
- Uses Wing Buffet to knock enemies off cliffs (falling damage: 1 HD per 10 yards)
- Creates rockslides with roar (2 HD bludgeoning to 30-yard line)
- Nests in caves with narrow entrances (chokepoint favors Wyrm's size)
- Encounter design: Mountain ledge with steep drops, rock formations for cover

**Schism-Scarred Enforcer** (Urban/Ruins):
- Uses Chains to drag victims toward hazards
- Collapses weak structures (1-3 HD damage, creates difficult terrain)
- Environment "corrupts" over time—walls crack, shadows deepen
- Encounter design: Collapsing warehouse district with unstable floors, falling debris

**Memory Devourer** (Ancient Ruins):
- Erased zones become "forgotten space" (difficult terrain, characters become disoriented)
- Historical echoes manifest as temporal hazards (reliving battles, sudden environmental shifts)
- Can trap prey in memory loops (Resolve-based escape)
- Encounter design: Cyclopean library with shifting architecture, unreliable reality

#### Lair Actions

For major encounters (Expert+ creatures in their territory), use **Lair Actions** on initiative count 20 (losing ties):

**Example Lair Actions:**

**Verdant Domain** (Thymera-blessed forests):
- Roots erupt in 15-yard radius (difficult terrain + 1 HD piercing to creatures caught)
- Canopy closes (lighting drops to dim, advantage to defenders)
- Healing sap flows (forest creatures regain 1d6 HD)

**Gloam-Touched Ruins** (Aralys's domain):
- Shadows deepen (vision reduced to 10 yards, Gloam creatures gain +2d6 stealth)

- Death-touched wind (deal 1 HD necrotic to all living creatures)

**Schism-Scarred Territory** (Azravael's corruption):
- Reality tears (10-yard zone warps; all inside roll defense or take 2 HD force damage)
- Chains erupt from ground (restrain random target, requires Expert 4+ Strength check to break)
- Contract bindings glow (creatures who've broken oaths take 1 HD psychic damage)

**River of Memory** (Aluneth's currents):
- Tidebound surge (water rises, creates difficult terrain, may knock prone)
- Memory flash (all creatures witness historical event; Resolve check or become stunned 1 round)
- Clear waters (all lies revealed, all invisible creatures become visible)

#### Rangers & Terrain Mastery

Rangers excel at environmental combat:

- **Natural Camouflage:** +2d6 stealth in wilderness
- **Tracker's Eye:** Can identify best tactical positions (grants allies environmental bonuses)

**Encounter Design for Rangers:**
- Use natural cover extensively (forests, rocky terrain)
- Include tracking or ambush opportunities
- Reward environmental awareness (hidden paths, safe crossings)
- Let Rangers prepare battlefield (set traps, identify hazards)

#### Priests & Sanctified Ground

Priests reshape sacred spaces:
- **Hallowed Ground:** 10-yard radius becomes difficult terrain for enemies, grants allies +1d6 defense
- **Sanctuary:** Designated zone prevents hostile actions (enemies must pass Resolve check to attack)
- **Divine Anchor:** Corrupted terrain can be cleansed (removes Schism taint, Gloam darkness)
- **Zone Control:** Priests excel at controlling specific battlefield areas

**Encounter Design for Priests:**
- Include desecrated sites to be reclaimed
- Use zone-based challenges (defend altar, hold temple threshold)
- Incorporate divine/infernal terrain conflicts
- Reward positioning and area control

#### Quick Environmental Encounter Checklist

When designing encounters, consider:

1. **Terrain Type:** Forest, mountain, urban, ruins, water, etc.
2. **Key Features:** Chokepoints, elevated positions, hazards, cover
3. **Lighting:** Bright, dim, darkness, shifting
4. **Movement:** Normal, difficult, hazardous, vertical elements
5. **Hazards:** Environmental damage sources, unstable structures
6. **Lair Actions:** Does major creature control environment?
7. **Class Synergy:** Does terrain favor party's Rangers/Priests/tactical specialists?

**Examples:**

- Oath-inscribed floor (glows when lies spoken, Concordant Halls connection)

**Mountain Pass** (favors mobility and range):
- Narrow ledges (chokepoint, falling hazard 3-5 HD)
- Loose scree (difficult terrain, Agility check to avoid slide)
- Strong winds (-1d6 to ranged attacks)
- Elevated firing positions (height advantage for archers)

**Schism-Scarred Wasteland** (hostile to all):
- Reality tears (random 10-yard zones of warped space, 2 HD force damage)
- Ash storms (visibility reduced, -1d6 to attacks)
- Unstable ground (may collapse into void)
- No natural life (Rangers lose terrain advantage)

### Scaling Creatures

- Add +1 Proficiency
- Add special ability
- Add Elite trait: +2d6 to one specific action type

**To decrease difficulty:**
- Remove -2 HD per tier decrease

### Cosmological Connections

Most creatures tie to specific deities or Custodial Powers:

**Concordant Halls:** Archons, Oath-Breaker Shades, Revenant Knights  
**Living Accord:** Verdant creatures, Primal Wyrms, Crownstags  
**Curator Arcanum:** Memory creatures, Threshold Walkers, Scholars  
**Azravael's Schism:** All Schism-Scarred, Death Knights, Heralds  
**Aralys's Gloam:** Moonbound, Pale Shepherds, Pall-Wolves  
**Iosyx's Chaos:** Elementals, Flame Titans, Chaos Fragments

Use these connections for narrative hooks and faction conflicts.
