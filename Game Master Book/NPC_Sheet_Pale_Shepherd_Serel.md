# AFFINITY NPC SHEET
## Serel the Half-Passed (Pale Shepherd Aspirant)

*A morally complex NPC for Gloam-focused adventures*

---

### NPC IDENTITY

**Name:** Serel the Half-Passed  
**Type:** Humanoid (Human, Gloam-Touched)  
**Level:** 4 | **Proficiency:** 2  
**Role:** Guide, Potential Ally, Potential Antagonist

---

### OVERVIEW

Serel died three years ago. She remembers the plague, remembers her wife holding her hand, remembers the last breath. Then she woke in the Gloam—not as a ghost, but still *her*, still breathing, still alive in a realm of the dead. Aralys's Pale Shepherds found her wandering during a Vigil-tide, too stubborn to accept her death but too alive to belong. They couldn't guide her onward because there was nowhere to guide her—she hadn't finished dying.

Now Serel walks the boundary between Mortal Weave and Gloam, learning the Shepherds' craft while searching for a way to either complete her death or return to true life. She helps travelers navigate the Gloam's dangers, but her motives are not purely altruistic. **She needs something from the living**: proof that her wife Mira still remembers her, or passage to a ritual site that might restore her, or simply someone to tell her she matters.

**The Core Tension:** Serel is helpful, knowledgeable, and genuinely kind—but she's also desperate, caught between states of being, and willing to manipulate travelers if it serves her goal.

---

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Ability 1: Half-Passed**
- **Trigger/Activation:** Passive
- **Effect:** Serel exists between life and death. She can see invisible undead, sense Mourning States within 100 yards, and step through thin barriers (doors, walls) in dim light. However, she cannot enter fully consecrated ground or cross running water without difficulty (-2d6 to all actions while crossing).
- **Frequency:** Always active
- **Notes:** The Pale Shepherds call her *"the one who won't finish dying."*

**Ability 2: Mourning State Attunement**
- **Trigger/Activation:** Passive / Environmental
- **Effect:** Serel gains bonuses based on the current Mourning State:
  - **Vigil:** +2d6 to social checks involving denial or confusion
  - **Remembrance:** +2d6 to Lore checks, can access stored memories in the Gloam
  - **Release:** +2d6 to Guide the Lost, can sense souls ready to pass
  - **Hollow:** Immune to identity-draining effects, but -2d6 to all social checks (emptiness bleeds through)
- **Frequency:** Changes when Mourning State shifts

**Ability 3: The Wife's Locket**
- **Trigger/Activation:** Triggered / When Serel takes critical damage or faces true death
- **Effect:** Serel clutches a locket containing a lock of Mira's hair. As long as Mira remembers her, Serel cannot be truly killed—she reforms in the Gloam at next sundown. If evidence proves Mira has forgotten her (or Mira dies), Serel loses this protection and can be permanently destroyed.
- **Frequency:** Once per day (reformation)
- **Notes:** **KEY WEAKNESS** — If party threatens the connection to Mira, Serel becomes desperate and dangerous.

---

### TRAITS & RESISTANCES

**Immunities:** Poison, disease, aging, exhaustion (already dead, mostly)

**Resistances:** Necrotic damage (+2d6 defense), fear effects

**Vulnerabilities:** 
- **Radiant damage** (burns the dead, even half-dead)
- **Running water** (tradition holds the dead cannot cross living water easily)
- **Proof of being forgotten** (if shown evidence Mira has moved on, Serel takes 2 Resolve damage immediately)

**Special Traits:**
- **Gloam-Walker:** Knows safe paths through the Gloam. Traveling with Serel reduces random Gloam encounters by half.
- **Desperate Hope:** Will do almost anything to see Mira again. Can be manipulated via this desire.
- **Shepherd's Ethics:** Won't harm the truly dead (ghosts, revenants) without just cause. Considers all undead potential souls to guide.
- **Fading:** If not reminded of her identity regularly (conversation, kindness), begins losing memories. After 1 week alone, forgets her name.

---

### TACTICS & BEHAVIOR

**Combat Strategy:**
- **Round 1:** Attempt diplomacy. "I don't want to fight. The dead taught me patience. Please—let's talk."
- **Round 2-3:** If attacked, use Mourning State Invocation to disable threats. Focus on disabling, not killing.
- **Round 4+:** If overwhelmed, flee through walls in dim light. Will not fight to true death if avoidable.
- **If Mira is mentioned:** Freezes. Asks questions. Combat pauses if party has information about her wife.

**Defensive Positioning:**
- Uses spectral phasing to avoid direct confrontation
- Retreats toward areas of stronger Mourning States (where her abilities improve)
- Calls for aid from local Gloam creatures (Moonbound Watchers, Candlewights) if desperate

**Motivation:**
- **Primary:** Find a way back to Mira, or confirm Mira hasn't forgotten her
- **Secondary:** Earn the Pale Shepherds' recognition by guiding souls
- **Hidden:** Terrified that she's already becoming a Hollow Drifter and doesn't know it

**Personality Notes:**
- Speaks softly, as if sound itself might disturb the dead
- Laughs unexpectedly at dark humor—"dying gives you perspective"
- Touches her locket constantly
- Asks travelers about their families, their homes—lives vicariously through their connections
- If asked about her death: "It wasn't peaceful. But I'm told the plague never is."

**Victory Conditions:**
- **Ally Path:** Help Serel find/contact Mira (wife is alive in coastal village, grieving but hasn't remarried)
- **Resolution Path:** Help Serel accept her death and pass on peacefully (Guide the Lost ritual, requires Serel's consent)
- **Betrayal Path:** Destroy her connection to Mira (cruel, but effective)

**Retreat Conditions:**
- If reduced below 8 HD
- If party proves sympathetic and offers alliance
- If Hollow Mourning State begins (she flees before losing herself)

### SOCIAL COMBAT & ROLEPLAY

Serel can be approached through multiple frames:

**Approach: Offer Hope**
- Moderate (3+) Influence check
- *"We can help you find Mira. We're heading toward the coast anyway."*
- **Success:** Serel becomes tentative ally. Will guide party through Gloam dangers.
- **Failure:** Serel suspects manipulation. "Everyone promises. No one delivers."

**Approach: Present Evidence of Mira**
- Basic (2+) if truthful, Expert (4+) if fabricated
- Show letter, portrait, or personal item connected to Mira
- **Success:** Serel weeps (ectoplasmic tears, cold as snow). Becomes devoted ally.
- **Failure (if fabricated):** Serel senses the lie. "You would use my wife against me?" Becomes hostile.

**Approach: Offer Release**
- Expert (4+) Religion/Lore check (must understand Guide the Lost ritual)
- *"You've been half-passed for three years. The Shepherds haven't accepted you because you won't let go. Mira would want you to find peace."*
- **Success:** Serel considers it. Opens dialogue about what Release means. Possible peaceful resolution.
- **Failure:** Serel recoils. "You want me to die? To *finish* dying? No. I won't."

**Approach: Threaten Mira**
- **DO NOT RECOMMEND** — but players may try
- Any threat to Mira (real or implied) causes Serel to attack immediately with all abilities
- Serel gains +2d6 to all actions while defending Mira's memory
- This closes all peaceful paths permanently

### LOOT & REWARDS

**On Defeat (Combat):**
- **Shepherd's Crook** — Spectral weapon, +1 quality, deals force damage, can reach through thin barriers
- **Gloam-Walker's Vestments** — Light armor, +1d6 defense in dim light, allows passage through thin walls 1/day
- **The Wife's Locket** — Contains lock of Mira's hair. If returned to Mira, she weeps and gives party blessing (advantage on next death save). If kept, functions as 1/day protection against soul-claiming effects.

**On Alliance:**
- **Safe Passage** — Serel guides party through Gloam, halving random encounters
- **Mourning State Reading** — Serel can sense which Mourning State dominates an area, helping party prepare
- **Contact: Pale Shepherds** — Serel can arrange introduction to Pale Shepherd NPCs for information, guidance, or funeral rites
- **Questline:** Serel asks party to deliver message to Mira (coastal village, 3 days travel). Completing this earns permanent Gloam-Touched Ally (Serel appears once per adventure to assist in Gloam-related situations).

**On Peaceful Release:**
- **Shepherd's Blessing** — Party receives Aralys's favor: next time a party member dies, they have +3d6 on death saves
- **Emotional Closure** — Mira receives closure through dream-message (if party informs her later)
- **Pale Shepherd Recognition** — Party gains reputation with Gloam factions as "friends of the forgotten"

**Experience Award:** 
- 150 XP if defeated in combat
- 250 XP if allied successfully
- 300 XP if Serel achieves peaceful Release (hardest, most meaningful outcome)

### DM NOTES

**Scaling Suggestions:**
- **For Level 2 Party:** Reduce HD to 16, Proficiency to 1 (newly half-passed, less skilled)
- **For Level 6+ Party:** Increase HD to 30, add Legendary action (Mourning State Invocation as reaction)
- **With Gloam Allies:** Serel can call 1d4 Candlewights or 1 Moonbound Watcher if party attacks first

**Roleplay Tips:**
- **Voice:** Soft, contemplative, with unexpected moments of dark humor. "I've been dead for three years. Or alive. Depends who you ask."
- **Body Language:** Touches her locket. Stands slightly translucent in bright light. Looks through walls when nervous.
- **Dialogue:** Short sentences, but thoughtful. Asks questions. Genuinely curious about living experiences.
- **Key Phrase:** *"I'm not a ghost. I'm not alive. I'm the space between breaths. And I'm tired."*

**Environmental Factors:**
- **During Vigil:** Serel is strongest here. Combat favors her. Enemies forget attacks.
- **During Remembrance:** Serel is helpful here. Can access deep lore, show visions.
- **During Release:** Serel is vulnerable here. Feels the pull to pass on. May become melancholy.
- **During Hollow:** Serel flees or hides. Will not fight. Terrified of becoming a Drifter.

**Connecting to Cosmology:**
- **Aralys:** The goddess of death and mercy. Serel prays to her for guidance but receives no answer.
- **Pale Shepherds:** Serel wants to be one. They tolerate her but haven't accepted her—she must prove she can let go.
- **Mourning States:** Use these to create dynamic encounters. The Gloam's emotional weather affects everything.
- **Thalos:** God of consequence. Serel wonders if her half-death is consequence for something.

**Campaign Hooks:**
1. **The Lost Wife:** Party hired to deliver message to Mira. Serel is the messenger—but can she let go after seeing her wife alive?
2. **Hollow-Tide Rising:** A Hollow Mourning State is consuming a region. Serel knows how to stop it but needs party's help—and protection.
3. **Shepherd's Trial:** The Pale Shepherds have offered Serel a test: guide one soul willingly to Release. She asks party to help her find a willing soul.
4. **The Forgotten Village:** An entire village is trapped in Vigil, repeating their last day alive. Serel can break the loop—but it means forcing them to accept their deaths.

*"The dead are patient. The living are desperate. I'm neither, so I just... wait. But I'm tired of waiting."*

— Serel the Half-Passed

---

**GM Philosophy Note:**
Serel is designed as a **sympathetic liminal figure**—neither villain nor helper until the party decides how to engage. Her desperation makes her relatable but potentially dangerous. Use her to explore themes of grief, letting go, and what it means to be remembered. The best outcomes require empathy; the worst outcomes happen when party exploits her vulnerability.

Like Captain Marcus, Serel tests whether the party values mercy over efficiency. But where Marcus is a fallen hero, Serel is a desperate soul. Different emotional register, same core question: **Will you help someone who can't help themselves?**
