# Game Master's Guide

## Core Philosophy

This game is a **heroic risk-attrition system** prioritizing:

1. **Dice pool resolution (d6)** — No d20, clean success counting
2. **Exertion as risk** — Commitment costs health
3. **Hit Dice as universal resource** — Health, power, stamina all from one pool
4. **Tiered Success Thresholds** — Clear power ladder (2+/3+/4+/5+/6)
5. **Explosive 6s** — Each 6 = 2 successes, natural drama
6. **Resolve as encounter clock** — Fights end decisively

---

## Running Skill Challenges

### Understanding the Skill/Domain System

**Core Principle:** Skills are **context domains**, not trainable attributes. They define when abilities apply, not what those abilities grant.

**Key Philosophy:**
- Any character can attempt any roll in any domain
- No "skill monkey" characters who monopolize checks
- Class abilities, feats, and features grant bonus dice when specific domains apply
- Players remember and invoke their abilities when domains are relevant
- GMs identify which skill domain applies to challenges

**The Eight Skill Domains:**
1. **Agility** — Precision movement, stealth, dexterous manipulation
2. **Awareness** — Sensing, insight, investigation
3. **Fortitude** — Physical resistance, holding out, resilience
4. **Wilderness** — Tracking, navigation, animals, foraging
5. **Influence** — Persuasion, deception, intimidation
6. **Lore** — History, arcana, religion, theory
7. **Medicine** — Healing, anatomy, diagnosis
8. **Craft** — Making, repairing, engineering

---

### GM Domain Calling Protocol

**When presenting a challenge, announce the primary domain:**

✅ **Good Domain Calls:**
- "The ancient door has runic locks. This is a **Lore** challenge to decode them."
- "You need to sneak past the guards. This is an **Agility** check."
- "The cliff face is treacherous. This is a **Fortitude** challenge to endure the climb."

❌ **Unclear Domain Calls:**
- "You need to get past the door." *(Which domain? Players can't invoke abilities)*
- "Roll to succeed." *(No context for which abilities apply)*

**Allow Player Advocacy:**
Players can suggest alternate domains with justification:
> **Player:** "Can I use **Awareness** to watch patrol patterns instead of **Agility** to sneak?"
> **GM:** "Yes! Roll Proficiency + Exertion, and if you have Awareness abilities, they apply."

**Multi-Domain Challenges:**
Some challenges can use multiple domains:
- **Primary Domain:** Full bonus dice from abilities
- **Secondary Domain:** +1d6 if you justify your approach
- **Example:** "This is primarily **Agility** to sneak, but **Awareness** can grant +1d6 if you scout patrol routes first."

---

### Prompting Players for Abilities

**Cognitive Load Challenge:** Players must remember 3-8 different abilities spread across class features, feats, and special features—then recognize when domains apply mid-game.

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**1. Direct Domain Prompting:**
After calling the domain, prompt for abilities:
> **GM:** "This is a **Wilderness** check to track the beast. Does anyone have abilities for Wilderness?"
> **Players:** *Check character sheets, invoke Nature's Treaty, Survivalist feat, etc.*

**2. Ability Recognition Cues:**
When players narrate actions, identify potential domains:
> **Player:** "I want to examine the ancient script on the wall."
> **GM:** "That sounds like **Lore**. Do you have any Lore abilities?"

**3. Encourage Ability Summarization:**
At session start, ask: "What domains are you good at? What abilities do you have?"

---

### Preventing Common Pitfalls

#### **Pitfall 1: Players Forget Their Abilities**

**Problem:** Player has +2d6 Lore but forgets during challenge, misses by 1 success.

**Solutions:**
- **Domain Reference Cards:** Create quick-reference cards listing each character's domain bonuses
- **Competency Summary on Character Sheet:**
  ```
  DOMAIN PROFICIENCIES
  ☑ Agility (+3d6) - From: Shadow Step, Quick Reflexes, Acrobatic Feat
  ☑ Wilderness (+2d6) - From: Nature's Treaty
  ☐ Lore - No bonuses
  ```
- **Post-Roll Correction Window:** Allow players to invoke abilities after rolling if they forgot: "Oh wait, I have Arcane Study! Can I add those dice?"

#### **Pitfall 2: Domain Arbitration Disputes**

**Problem:** Players disagree with GM's domain call.

**Solutions:**
- **Explain Reasoning:** "I'm calling this Agility because the focus is physical dexterity, but I'm open to arguments."
- **Allow Hybrid Approaches:** "You can use Awareness for +1d6 if you scout first, then Agility for the main check."
- **Consistency Over Perfection:** Once you rule on a domain for a situation type, stay consistent in that campaign.

#### **Pitfall 3: Invisible Competence**

**Problem:** New players don't realize what their character is good at because there's no "+5 Stealth" on the sheet.

**Solutions:**
- **Character Creation Guidance:** "Which domains do you want to excel in? Let's choose class abilities and feats accordingly."
- **Explicit Competency List:** Character sheets should list: "You're good at [domains] because of [abilities]."
- **Session Zero Clarification:** Explain skill system clearly: "Domains are categories. Your abilities tell you when you're good at things in those categories."

#### **Pitfall 4: Uneven Domain Coverage**

**Problem:** Some classes naturally touch more domains than others.

**Solutions:**
- **Class Audits:** Ensure each class has abilities covering 2-3 domains naturally
- **Path Board Balance:** Feats should explicitly cover all 8 domains
- **Design Principle:** Every class should have at least one skill-boosting ability by Level 3

### Ability Wording Best Practices

**Template for Clear Abilities:**
```markdown
**[Ability Name] ([Primary Domain(s)]):**
When you [specific trigger], gain +Xd6 (doesn't burn HD on 1s).

Examples: [2-3 concrete examples]
```

**Comparison:**

❌ **Bad Ability (unclear):**
> **Nature's Treaty:** You gain bonus dice when appropriate.

✅ **Good Ability (crystal clear):**
> **Nature's Treaty (Wilderness):** When you roll for tracking, navigation, animal handling, or foraging, gain +2d6 (doesn't burn HD on 1s).
> 
> *Examples: Following wolf tracks through snow, finding safe passage through mountains, calming a spooked horse.*

**Key Elements:**
1. **Domain Label:** Shows which domain triggers it
2. **Specific Trigger:** Clear conditions ("when you roll for X, Y, or Z")
3. **Bonus Amount:** Exact dice ("gain +2d6")
4. **HD Burn Clarification:** "doesn't burn HD on 1s" (trained reliability)
5. **Concrete Examples:** Helps players recognize applicable situations

---

### Designing Skill Challenges

**Core Philosophy: Group Rolls Are Default**

Affinity is designed to avoid "skill monkey" and "face" character problems. Most skill challenges should be **group rolls** where everyone contributes and successes are pooled. The party wins or fails together.

**Scaling Difficulty for Group Size:**

| Difficulty | Base Successes | Per Extra Player (beyond 1) |
|------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Easy | 3 | +1 |
| Medium | 5 | +2 |
| Hard | 8 | +3 |

*Example: 4-player party, Hard challenge = 8 + (3 × 3) = 17 successes needed*

**When to Use Individual Rolls:**
- Initiative-order actions (each character acts separately)
- Personal consequences (resisting poison, concentration)
- Spotlight moments (one character attempting something unique)
- GM discretion based on fiction

---

**Single-Domain Challenges:**
- Clear, focused obstacles
- One primary approach
- Example: "Decode the ancient runes" (**Lore**)

**Multi-Domain Challenges:**
- Complex obstacles with multiple valid approaches
- Reward creative thinking
- Example: "Get past the guarded gate"
  - **Agility:** Sneak past
  - **Influence:** Talk your way in
  - **Craft:** Create distractions with gadgets
  - **Awareness:** Study patrol patterns for timing

**Group Challenges (Default):**
- Multiple characters contribute simultaneously
- Each rolls using their strengths (different domains welcome)
- Pool successes toward a scaled target
- Example: "Navigate the treacherous mountain pass"
  - Ranger uses **Wilderness** to find the path
  - Combatant uses **Fortitude** to help carry supplies
  - Scholar uses **Lore** to identify safe routes from maps
  - Target: 12 successes needed, group pools their rolls

---

### Resolution Examples

**Example 1: Single Character, Clear Domain**

> **GM:** "The vault door has an intricate lock mechanism. This is a **Craft** challenge. Required: 4 successes, Advanced threshold (3+)."
> 
> **Player (Scholar):** "I have Mechanical Expertise—that's Craft, right?"
> **GM:** "Correct! You get +2d6."
> **Player:** "I'll use Proficiency 3 + 2 Exertion + 2 Mechanical Expertise = 7d6."
> **Roll:** 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1
> **Successes:** 5 (one 6=2, plus four 3+) — Success! Lock opens.
> **HD Burn:** 2 HD burned (two 1s on exertion dice, but not on the Mechanical Expertise dice)

**Example 2: Multiple Approaches**

> **GM:** "You need information from the merchant. How do you approach?"
> 
> **Player 1 (Sovereign):** "I'll use **Influence** to persuade him—I have Silver Tongue."
> **Player 2 (Scholar):** "Can I use **Lore** to impress him with knowledge of his trade goods?"
> **GM:** "Both work! Who's taking the lead?"
> **Player 1:** "I'll try first."
> **GM:** "Roll **Influence**, Advanced threshold (3+), need 3 successes."

**Example 3: Forgotten Ability**

> **Player:** "I'm tracking the bandits. Rolling Proficiency 3 + 2 Exertion = 5d6."
> **GM:** "Hold on—this is a **Wilderness** check. Do you have Wilderness abilities?"
> **Player:** *(checks sheet)* "Oh! I have Nature's Treaty! That's +2d6 for tracking!"
> **GM:** "Add them to your pool—7d6 total."

### Domain Application Guidelines

**How Often Should Each Domain Appear?**

Track domain usage across 3-4 sessions. Aim for:
- Each domain appears **at least once** per session
- No domain dominates (appearing 50%+ of the time)
- Combat-focused sessions still include 2-3 non-combat domain checks

**If Domains Never Appear:**
- **Agility:** Add stealth, escape, or precision challenges
- **Awareness:** Add investigation, ambush detection, hidden clues
- **Fortitude:** Add endurance tests, poison/disease, harsh environments
- **Wilderness:** Add travel, tracking, foraging, animal encounters
- **Influence:** Add social encounters, negotiations, deception
- **Lore:** Add ancient knowledge, arcane puzzles, historical context
- **Medicine:** Add injury consequences, disease outbreaks, healing challenges
- **Craft:** Add equipment repair, trap disassembly, fortification building

**If Domains Are Never Useful:**
Consider merging underpowered domains or expanding their scope.

---

### Encouraging Player Engagement

**Session Start Check-In:**
> **GM:** "Before we start, remind me: what domains is everyone good at?"
> **Players:** List their primary competencies

**Mid-Session Validation:**
When players invoke abilities correctly:
> **GM:** "Great catch! Your Lore ability definitely applies here. Roll with the bonus."

**Post-Session Reflection:**
> **GM:** "Did you feel like your abilities came up? Were there moments you wished you had different domain coverage?"

---

### Training New Players

**Session Zero Skill Explanation:**
> "Skills in this game work differently than D&D. There are 8 domains—categories like Agility, Lore, Wilderness. Your character doesn't have skill ranks. Instead, your class abilities and feats give you bonus dice when specific domains apply. The GM will tell you which domain a challenge uses, and you check if you have abilities for it."

**During Character Creation:**
> "Think about what you want your character to be good at. If you want to be sneaky, look for abilities that grant bonuses for Agility. If you want to be a knowledge expert, pick abilities for Lore."

**First Session Reminders:**
- Keep domain list visible for everyone
- Prompt liberally: "This is Agility—anyone have Agility abilities?"
- Allow rewinds: "You forgot your ability? Let's reroll with it included."

---

### Success Metrics

**System Is Working When:**
- ✅ Players invoke their abilities without prompting
- ✅ Multiple characters contribute to group challenges
- ✅ Domain calls feel intuitive and fair
- ✅ All 8 domains appear across sessions
- ✅ Players choose abilities based on desired domain coverage

**System Needs Adjustment When:**
- ❌ Players consistently forget abilities
- ❌ Same 2-3 domains dominate every session
- ❌ Domain rulings cause frequent disputes
- ❌ Players feel locked out of challenges ("I can't do anything")
- ❌ Abilities are unclear about which domains they apply to

**Iterate Based on Playtest Data:**
Track which abilities players struggle to remember or apply. Reword them for clarity. Add examples to problematic abilities.

---

## Running NPCs

**NPCs—whether allies, adversaries, or neutral parties—use simplified mechanics to reduce GM cognitive load while preserving the core dice pool system.**

---

### Core NPC Design Philosophy

**NPCs Are Streamlined:**
- **No exertion budgets:** NPCs roll fixed dice pools shown in stat blocks
- **No HD burn from 1s:** Simplifies tracking (only players suffer death spirals)
- **Variable actions:** Higher-tier NPCs get more actions to challenge parties
- **Variable Resolve:** Unlike PCs (always 5), NPCs have tier-based Resolve

**Why Simplify NPCs?**
- You may run 3-8 NPCs simultaneously in combat
- Complex exertion decisions slow the game
- Players should be the stars—detailed resource management is their spotlight
- NPCs need to be dangerous without heavy bookkeeping

---

### NPC Power Tiers

| Tier | Actions Per Turn | Max Resolve | Typical Use |
|------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Trivial** | 1 | 2 | Cannon fodder, harmless NPCs |
| **Basic** | 1-2 | 2 | Standard encounters, guards, bandits |
| **Advanced** | 1-2 | 3 | Mid-level threats, skilled warriors |
| **Expert** | 2 | 4 | Mini-bosses, elite enemies |
| **Legendary** | 2 + ½ party size (up) | 5+ | Major bosses, epic encounters |
| **Ultimate** | 2 + ½ party size (up) | 8+ | World-threatening entities |
| **Mythical** | 2 + party size (up) | 11+ | Reality-warping cosmic forces |

**Party Size Scaling:**
- 4 PCs = Legendary NPC gets 4 actions (2 + 2)
- 6 PCs = Legendary NPC gets 5 actions (2 + 3)
- This prevents solo bosses from being overwhelmed by action economy

---

### NPC Action Tier Restrictions

**NPCs follow tier restrictions similar to player characters:**

**General Rule (All NPCs):**
- **Only 1 action may be Expert tier or higher per turn** (same as PCs)
- Once an NPC uses an Expert/Advanced/Ultimate/Mythical action, remaining actions must be Basic or Advanced tier

**Tier-Specific Limits (High-Tier NPCs):**
- **Legendary NPCs:** May use no more than **1 Legendary-tier action per round**
- **Ultimate NPCs:** May use no more than **1 Ultimate-tier action per round**
- **Mythical NPCs:** May use no more than **1 Mythical-tier action per round**

**What This Means:**

A Legendary Dragon with 4 actions might use:
- 1 Legendary Breath Weapon (Legendary tier)
- 2 Claw Attacks (Basic or Advanced tier)
- 1 Tail Sweep (Basic or Advanced tier)

The dragon CANNOT use its Legendary Breath Weapon twice in one round, even though it has 4 actions.

**Design Rationale:**
- Prevents "spam the best ability" tactics
- Creates dynamic combat (bosses use variety of attacks)
- Preserves tier restrictions as meaningful across all combatants
- High-tier actions remain special, not routine

---

### NPC Triggered Actions & Held Actions

**NPCs can also use triggered actions and hold actions:**

**Triggered Actions:**
- Some NPCs have reaction-style abilities (\"when hit, deal 1d6 fire damage to attacker\")
- These use one of the NPC's actions for the round
- If NPC has already acted, they cannot use triggered actions (unless ability specifically allows)

**Held Actions:**
- NPCs can hold actions just like PCs (\"orc holds javelin throw until player moves into range\")
- If trigger occurs: NPC uses held action immediately
- If no trigger by round end: Held action may only be used for Basic tier actions

**GM Tip:** Use held actions to create tension and make intelligent enemies feel tactical, but don't overcomplicate. Most basic enemies just act on their turn.

---

### Running NPC Actions

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Check Stat Block:** Find the action you want the NPC to take
2. **Roll Dice Pool:** Roll the exact dice shown (e.g., "Rolls: 5d6")
3. **Count Successes:** Meet threshold based on action tier
4. **Deal Damage/Apply Effect:** Use base damage + bonus (capped at Proficiency)
5. **Move On:** Don't track exertion or HD burn from 1s

**Example:**
```
Orc Raider attacks the Combatant with Greataxe:
- Rolls: 3d6 (as shown in stat block)
- Result: 5, 4, 2 = 2 successes (Basic threshold 2+)
- Required: 1 success
- Damage: 2 HD base + 1 HD bonus (1 extra success, capped) = 3 HD
- Combatant defends with armor...
```

No exertion decision. No HD burn tracking. Just roll, count, damage.

---

### Dice Pools in Stat Blocks

**What "Rolls: 5d6" Means:**
- The NPC's Proficiency dice (core competence)
- + Typical exertion/aggression level
- = Fixed total for simplicity

**Dice pools represent NPCs fighting at consistent intensity.** You don't calculate Proficiency + chosen exertion each turn—just roll what's listed.

**Adjusting Difficulty Mid-Combat:**
- **Too Easy?** Describe increased aggression, add +1-2d6
- **Too Hard?** Describe fatigue, reduce by 1-2d6
- **Perfect as-is?** Roll what's written

---

### Reckless Traits

Some NPCs have **conditional power spikes** instead of exertion choices:

**Example Reckless Traits:**
```
- Blood Rage: When below half HD, rolls 5d6 instead of 3d6 for attacks
- Pack Tactics: When ally within 5 yards of target, rolls +1d6
- Desperate Fury: When an ally dies, rolls +2d6 for 2 rounds
```

These create dynamic encounters without exertion micromanagement.

---

### NPC Defense Rolls

**NPCs use the same layered defense system as PCs:**

1. **Defense Capacity:** Proficiency (min 1 die)
2. **Layers:** Magical barriers (d12) → Armor temp HD → Permanent HD
3. **Roll & Check:** Roll capacity dice using layer's die type, meet 5+ threshold
4. **Simplification:** 1s on NPC defense rolls **do NOT burn HD**

**Example:**
```
Verdant Guardian (Prof 3, Armor 2d10 temp HD) takes 4 HD fire damage:
- Defense Capacity: 3 dice
- Rolls: 2d10 (armor layer)
- Result: 7, 2 = 1 success (meets 5+ threshold)
- Outcome: Defense succeeds! Armor depletes (loses 2d10 temp HD), permanent HD untouched
```

---

### NPC Resolve

**Unlike PCs (who always have Resolve 5), NPCs vary by tier:**

- **Trivial/Basic (Resolve 2):** Easily demoralized, flee when bloodied
- **Advanced (Resolve 3):** Moderate willpower, fight until clear defeat
- **Expert (Resolve 4):** Disciplined, retreat only when tactically smart
- **Legendary+ (Resolve 5-11+):** Exceptional conviction, fight to death or victory

**Use Resolve Narratively:**
- When NPC reaches 0 Resolve: Demoralized, surrenders, or flees
- Social encounters can reduce Resolve before combat even starts
- High-Resolve NPCs make heroic last stands or villain monologues

---

### Multiple Actions for High-Tier NPCs

**Why Legendary+ NPCs Get Extra Actions:**
- 4-6 PCs taking 2 actions each = 8-12 actions per round
- 1 boss with 2 actions = severely outmatched
- Extra actions create epic, multi-phase encounters

**Using Multiple Actions Tactically:**

**Legendary Dragon (6 actions vs 6-person party):**
1. **Action 1:** Claw attack on Fighter
2. **Action 2:** Claw attack on Rogue
3. **Action 3:** Breath Weapon (area attack, hits 4 PCs)
4. **Action 4:** Tail Sweep (knocks back melee characters)
5. **Action 5:** Wing Buffet (creates distance)
6. **Action 6:** Take flight (repositions)

**Describe actions narratively as a fluid sequence:**
> "The dragon lashes out with both claws, then rears back and unleashes a torrent of flame across the battlefield! Its tail sweeps the ground, wings buffet the air, and it launches skyward!"

---

### Encounter Building with NPCs

**Action Economy Balance:**

**Horde Encounter (Many Weak NPCs):**
- 8 Basic-tier Orcs (1-2 actions each) vs 4 PCs
- Total NPC actions: ~12
- PC actions: ~8
- Outcome: Overwhelming numbers, players must prioritize targets

**Elite Encounter (Few Strong NPCs):**
- 2 Expert-tier Captains (2 actions each) vs 4 PCs
- Total NPC actions: 4
- PC actions: ~8
- Outcome: Players have action advantage but enemies are individually dangerous

**Boss Encounter (One Legendary NPC):**
- 1 Legendary-tier Dragon (6 actions) vs 4 PCs
- Total NPC actions: 6
- PC actions: ~8
- Outcome: Near-parity, dragon can threaten multiple PCs per turn

**Mixed Encounter:**
- 1 Expert Captain (2 actions) + 4 Basic Guards (1 action each) vs 4 PCs
- Total NPC actions: 6
- PC actions: ~8
- Outcome: Leader coordinates minions, players must split focus

---

### Social Encounters with NPCs

**NPCs in Social Conflicts:**
- Use the same social attack rules as PCs (target Resolve)
- Roll fixed dice pools (no exertion choices)
- Track Resolve damage normally

**Example:**
```
Noble NPC (Proficiency 3, Resolve 4)
- Cutting Insult (Influence attack):
  - Rolls: 4d6 (fixed pool)
  - Required: 2 (Advanced threshold)
  - Resolve Damage: 1 base + bonus (capped at Prof 3)
```

**Reducing NPC Resolve Before Combat:**
If PCs demoralize guards through Influence:
- Guards start combat at reduced Resolve
- May flee earlier or fight less aggressively
- Creates tactical advantage for clever players

---

### GM Tips for Streamlined NPC Management

**Reduce Cognitive Load:**
- ✅ Pre-roll initiative for NPC groups (treat as single initiative)
- ✅ Use average damage instead of rolling when managing 5+ NPCs
- ✅ Group identical NPCs ("The 3 orcs all attack" = one roll, split among targets)
- ✅ Let wounded NPCs flee or surrender (reduces combatants mid-fight)

**Increase Dynamism:**
- ✅ Describe Reckless traits triggering ("The wounded orc roars and attacks wildly!")
- ✅ Use environmental actions (flip tables, collapse scaffolding, ignite oil)
- ✅ Have NPCs call for reinforcements, retreat to better positions, or take hostages
- ✅ Adjust tactics based on PC actions ("The captain sees the Weaver casting and orders archers to focus fire")

**Track Only What Matters:**
- ✅ HP/HD (critical)
- ✅ Armor status (depleted or not)
- ✅ Resolve (for morale/social)
- ❌ Individual exertion budgets (not used by NPCs)
- ❌ HD burn from 1s (simplified away)

**When to Ignore Your Stat Blocks:**
- Combat is dragging? Reduce NPC HP mid-fight.
- Players steamrolling? Add reinforcements or increase dice pools.
- Epic moment opportunity? Let an NPC do something cool even if not in their stat block.

**Your stat blocks are tools, not laws. Adjust for narrative and pacing.**

---

## Running Combat Encounters

### Encounter Balance

**Action Count Matters:** Encounters are more dangerous when enemies have similar action economy to the party. One large enemy should have multi-actions or reactive abilities to match party action volume.

**Boss Action Economy:**
- **Expert-tier boss:** Takes actions equal to **2 + half the number of players** (rounded down)
- **Legendary/Mythical boss:** Takes actions equal to **2 + number of players**
- These extra actions prevent focus-fire obliteration and create dynamic encounters

**HD Guidelines by Enemy Count:**

- **Solo Boss:** 150-200% of party HD + extra actions (see above)
- **Equal Number of Enemies:** 75-100% of party HD
- **Swarm (more enemies than PCs):** 50-75% of party HD

**Why This Works:**
- 40 HD in one enemy without extra actions = focus-fire death
- 40 HD split across 4 enemies = distributed threats matching party actions
- Solo bosses need extra actions to survive concentrated attacks

### Enemy Design Template

**[Enemy Name]** (Level X)  
- **HD Pool:** XdY
- **Proficiency:** Half level (round up)
- **Resolve:** Equal to Proficiency
- **Attack:** [Action Name]
  - Tier: Basic/Advanced/Expert/Legendary
  - Rolls: Xd6
  - Required: X successes
  - Base Impact: X HD [damage type]
- **Special Ability:** Unique mechanic
- **Tactics:** How they fight

---

## Awarding Progression

### Experience Philosophy
**Don't use XP.** Instead, level characters when they:
- Complete a major story arc
- Overcome a significant challenge
- Reach narrative milestones

Typical progression: **1 level every 3-5 sessions**.

### Affinity Dice Awards
Grant Affinity Dice (d6s) when players:
- Embody their chosen Virtue dramatically
- Solve problems creatively
- Roleplay compelling character moments
- Make tactical sacrifices for the party

**Suggested Award Rate:**
- **Maximum Affinity gained per session = Proficiency**
- This prevents stockpiling and keeps Affinity as dramatic power, not baseline power
- At Level 5 (Prof 3), players can gain up to 3 Affinity Dice per session
- Encourages meaningful virtue embodiment rather than constant availability

---

### Burdens (Optional Roleplay Challenge)

**Burdens** are voluntary narrative responsibilities that players can take on to deepen their Affinity roleplay and create meaningful character choices.

**How Burdens Work:**

When a player accepts a Burden (offered by deities, cosmic forces, or earned through story events), they gain:
- **Benefit:** Enhanced connection to their Affinity (narrative power, special permissions, or unique abilities tied to the Burden's theme)
- **Cost:** A meaningful restriction or obligation that creates genuine roleplay tension

**Design Principles:**

- **Costs must trigger during play** (not theoretical): "Cannot flee while ally endangered" vs "Lose 1 HD per day"
- **Costs create meaningful choices** (not just taxes): "Must record significant knowledge or cannot Rest" forces engagement
- **Benefits feel earned** (not just "+1 to stat"): Special narrative permissions, thematic abilities, cosmic recognition

**Example Burdens:**

**Cornerstone Burden** (Guardian Affinity):
- **Benefit:** Designate one ally as your "Foundation" (1/long rest). While near you, they cannot be moved, knocked prone, or grappled against their will.
- **Cost:** You cannot flee combat while your Foundation is endangered. If your Foundation drops to 0 HD, you lose 1 Resolve (guilt/failure).

**Renewal Burden** (Decay Affinity):
- **Benefit:** When you witness or cause a necessary ending, you may grant an ally +1d6 to their next action (transformation energy flows through you).
- **Cost:** You must speak transformation words aloud when using this ability ("From decay—RENEWAL!"). If you cause unnecessary death or refuse to allow natural endings, you lose this burden until you atone.

**Keeper's Record Burden** (Memory Affinity):
- **Benefit:** Perfect recall of ANYTHING you've witnessed in the past 24 hours. You may teach knowledge to others, granting them +1d6 on their next check related to what you taught.
- **Cost:** You MUST record significant knowledge or events witnessed, or you cannot Rest (guilt prevents sleep). Carry a journal/tome/testament.

**When to Offer Burdens:**

- After major story climaxes (defeating bosses, completing arcs)
- When PCs form relationships with cosmic entities (deities, Custodial Powers, demi-gods)
- As rewards for deeply embodying Affinity principles over multiple sessions
- When players explicitly seek deeper connection to their Affinity

**When NOT to Use Burdens:**

- With new players still learning core mechanics
- In one-shot adventures (Burdens need time to create tension)
- As punishment for player choices
- To railroad players into specific behaviors

**Adjudicating Burdens:**

When a Burden's cost triggers:
1. **Narrate the consequence clearly:** "Your Foundation drops to 0 HD. Torvan, you feel the weight of failure—lose 1 Resolve."
2. **Allow player response:** Let them roleplay the guilt, determination, or conflict
3. **Don't waive costs:** If costs can be avoided easily, the Burden becomes meaningless

When a Burden's benefit is used:
1. **Celebrate the dramatic moment:** This is earned power, not a freebie
2. **Encourage thematic narration:** "Speak your transformation words!" / "How do you sanctify this space?"
3. **Reinforce cosmic connection:** "Khuldras recognizes your commitment. The earth itself stabilizes beneath you."

**Removing Burdens:**

Burdens can be voluntarily relinquished during long rests, but doing so:
- Loses the associated benefit permanently (or until re-earned)
- May disappoint the entity that granted it (narrative consequences)
- Represents a character choosing comfort over cosmic responsibility

Burdens can also be **lost involuntarily** if the PC violates their core principles (Renewal Burden lost if you commit unnecessary murder, Keeper's Record lost if you deliberately destroy knowledge, etc.).

**System Integration:**

Burdens are designed to:
- Create **roleplay pressure** that makes Affinity Dice spending more dramatic
- Reward players who deeply engage with their chosen Affinity
- Generate **story moments** where cosmic forces recognize mortal commitment
- Add **meaningful cost** to power without mechanical complexity

Burdens work beautifully when costs are **triggered during play**, create **meaningful choices**, and benefits feel **earned through sacrifice**.

## Treasure & Rewards

### Abolish Currency Tracking

**Gold and currency have no place in this game's mechanics.** Tracking coins is tedium.

**Instead:**
- Players and GM work together narratively to handle mundane expenses
- "You get a room for the night" — no gold tracking
- "You buy a round at the tavern" — assumed affordable
- "The blacksmith repairs your armor" — handled through downtime, not coin
- "You need better gear" — found through adventure, not shopping

**Currency exists in-world** (merchants trade, kingdoms mint coins), but **it's not a mechanical system players track**.

**Focus on tangible item rewards instead** — see Magic Items below.

### Magic Items

**See [Items & Artifacts](TTRPG_Items.md) for complete equipment, potions, and magical treasures catalog.**

**Awarding Frequency Suggestion:**
- **Common magical items:** 1-2 per 2 levels (purchased or found)
- **Basic magical items:** 1 per 2-3 levels  
- **Advanced magical items:** 1 per 3-4 levels
- **Expert magical items:** 1 per campaign arc (levels 5-7)
- **Legendary items:** 1-2 per entire campaign (major quest rewards)
- **Ultimate artifacts:** 0-1 per campaign
- **Mythical artifacts:** Campaign centerpieces, 0-1 per campaign (require 6 only to use)

---

## Social Encounters

Social encounters use the same dice pool resolution as combat:
- **Roll:** Proficiency + Exertion (class abilities may grant bonus dice if relevant domain applies)
- **Target:** Resolve instead of HD
- **Minimum Resolve:** Characters with Resolve below 2 cannot participate in social encounters
- **Initiative Bonus:** Characters who roll initiative and are not surprised gain 1 Resolve (max 5)

**Resolve Recovery:**
- **Short Rest:** Recover 1 Resolve
- **Long Rest (protected/safe):** Restore all Resolve to maximum (5)
- This ensures players can recover from social/mental exhaustion

See **Social Duels** in Core Mechanics for complete rules.

## Adjusting Difficulty

### If Players Are Struggling
- Reduce enemy HD pools by 25%
- **Adjust Required Success Threshold** (Expert 4+ → Advanced 3+)
- Introduce helpful NPCs or environmental advantages
- Allow more short rests
- Give Affinity Dice more freely

### If Players Are Dominating
- Increase enemy HD pools by 50%
- **Adjust Required Success Threshold** (Advanced 3+ → Expert 4+)
- Add Lair/Environmental actions
- Limit rest opportunities
- Introduce consequences from previous victories

**Threshold Tuning:**
Moving an enemy's action from 3+ to 4+ threshold is often more impactful than adding 5 HD. Use threshold adjustment as your primary difficulty knob—it changes success probability dramatically while keeping HP pools manageable.

## GM Best Practices

### Let Players Fail Forward
If they fail a check, don't just say "nothing happens." Give them partial success with complications.

### Avoid Static Stalemates
If combat becomes a grind:
- Trigger environmental effects
- Have enemies flee or change tactics
- Introduce third parties

### Reward Creativity
If players attempt something clever that's not in the rules:
- Set a DC appropriate to the difficulty
- Let them try even if it's unconventional
- Reward success with narrative impact
