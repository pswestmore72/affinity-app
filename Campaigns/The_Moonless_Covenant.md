---

## Campaign Hook

**Tidemark** is a small fishing village nestled where the **Greymist River** meets the sea. For generations, the **Stillwater Shrine**—a modest temple dedicated to **Aluneth, the Keeper of Tides and Memory**—has stood watch over the village. The shrine's tidal pool never stills, reflecting the moon's face even on cloudy nights. Villagers bring offerings, speak names of the drowned, and record their family histories in the shrine's sacred Tide-Ledgers.

**But three nights ago, something changed.**

The shrine was defaced. Sigils carved into stone. The tidal pool went dark and still—refusing to reflect the moon. The Tide-Ledgers were torn, pages scattered and burned. And at the altar, written in something black and oily: *"What is forgotten cannot bind you."*

**Sister Elyra** (Level 2 Priest of Aluneth) was found unconscious in the pool, nearly drowned. She survived, but speaks only in fragments: *"They wore masks of nothing... they want to erase Her... the moon will weep..."*

Worse still, villagers report strange symptoms:
- Fishermen forget the names of their boats
- A mother no longer recognizes her daughter's face
- An elder recounts a battle that never happened
- The village's founding story changes each time it's told

**Memory itself is unraveling in Tidemark.**

The village elder, **Borin Salthand** (retired sailor, Level 1 Combatant), approaches the party. Among them walks **[The Paladin PC]**, a devout follower of Aluneth. Last night, in a dream beneath deep waters, the Goddess herself reached out—not with words, but with *feeling*: **grief, violation, and a plea for aid**.

Someone is trying to sever Tidemark from memory. From continuity. From the tides. And if they succeed, the village—and everyone in it—will fade from existence as if they never were.

**The PCs must investigate the shrine, track the cultists, and stop whatever ritual is fracturing reality before the new moon—when Aluneth's presence is weakest.**

---

## Story Progression

### Session 1: The Shrine Defiled
**Level 1 - Investigation & First Clues**

#### Opening Scene: The Dream's Echo

The session begins with **[The Paladin PC]** waking from a vision:

*You stand at the bottom of the ocean. Above, the moon's light filters down through clear water, illuminating a massive shell-covered form—**Aluneth**, the Dragon Turtle, ancient and immense. But she is wounded. Black tendrils wrap around her shell, anchoring her down. She cannot rise to the surface. Her massive eye opens and looks at you—not with words, but with **raw emotional truth**: grief, betrayal, a sanctuary violated.*

*Then you see it: a shrine. YOUR shrine. Stillwater. It crumbles into ash. The memory of it erases from your mind even as you watch. You forget why you're here. Who you are.*

*"Remember," a voice echoes like distant waves. "Remember, or all will be forgotten."*

**Then you wake.**

The Paladin receives a **divine certainty**: Aluneth has called them specifically. This is not random vandalism—this is an attack on memory itself.

**Before Departing:**

If the Paladin/Priest wishes, they may perform **Aluneth's Anointing**—a brief ritual blessing the party for their quest:

**The Anointing Ritual** (10 minutes, requires moon-touched water from any natural source):
- The Paladin/Priest speaks the names of each party member, asking them to remember who they are and why they fight
- Traces a spiral shell symbol on each forehead with water
- Each PC receives: **Blessing of the Moonlit Path** (lasts until campaign end or death)

**Blessing Effects (choose one per PC based on their role):**
- **Memory's Anchor** (Scholar/Priest): +1d6 on checks to recall information, resist memory alteration, or decipher codes
- **Tide's Strength** (Combatant/Ranger): +1d6 on one attack roll per combat when protecting an ally
- **Lunar Clarity** (Weaver/Mage): +1d6 on one spell/ritual check per session when countering void/darkness magic
- **Current's Grace** (Rogue/Any): +1d6 on Stealth or Athletics checks when near water or under moonlight

**Roleplay Note:** This ritual reinforces party identity and creates a "remember your name" moment—thematically important against erasure.

---

#### Scene 1: Tidemark & The Unraveling

The party is in Tidemark (either arrived specifically to help, or the Paladin has brought them). The village is small (population ~150), built on docks and stilts over marshy ground where river meets sea. 

**Borin Salthand** gathers them at the **Anchor's Rest** tavern:
- *"Thank you for coming. Sister Elyra hasn't spoken clearly since the attack. The shrine's pool went black. And people... people are forgetting. My wife asked me this morning if we had children. We buried our son twenty years ago. She remembered him yesterday."*

**Investigation Phase - Three Priority Tasks:**

##### 1. Interview Sister Elyra (Social/Investigation)

**Location:** The village healer's hut

**Condition:** Elyra is awake but deeply traumatized. Her Resolve is at 1 (she's at breaking point). She keeps whispering names from the Tide-Ledgers, afraid if she stops speaking them, they'll vanish.

**What She Remembers (requires gentle Influence check, Basic 2+ for each question):**
- *"They came at high tide... when the pool should have been brightest."*
- *"Five of them. Wearing masks... but not masks. Where their faces should be was... nothing. Void. My eyes couldn't focus on them."*
- *"They chanted in a language that hurt to hear. It didn't sound like words—it sounded like... silence made audible."*
- *"Their leader carved something into the altar. A sigil. It drank the moonlight from the pool."*
- *"When I tried to stop them, they... they touched me. I forgot who I was. Forgot why I was there. I fell into the pool... only the water remembered me."*

**Advanced (3+) Influence or Priest/Religion check:**
- Elyra whispers about an old story: *"There's a legend. A forbidden cult from before the First Sowing. The **Nihil Covenant**—those who worship the Veil Beyond itself. They believe existence is suffering, and the only mercy is **erasure**. They don't kill—they unmake. Erase you from memory, and you cease to have ever existed."*

**Clue Gained:** The attackers are the **Nihil Covenant**, void-worshippers trying to erase Aluneth's presence from the Mortal Weave.

---

##### 2. Examine the Defaced Shrine (Investigation/Religion)

**Location:** Stillwater Shrine (10-minute walk from village, coastal bluff overlooking river mouth)

**Description:**
The shrine is a simple stone structure, open to the sky. At its center should be a circular tidal pool (15 feet across) that reflects the moon. Now the pool is dark, viscous, and still—like oil. The water doesn't move, even when disturbed.

**What They Find:**

**Basic (2+) Perception:**
- Sigils carved into the altar stone and pool edges (angular, painful to look at—eyes slide off them)
- Torn pages from the Tide-Ledgers scattered and partially burned
- Footprints leading from the shrine into the marshland (5 sets, humanoid, barefoot)

**Advanced (3+) Scholar/Priest (Religion):**
- The sigils are **erasure marks**—designed to sever a location from divine influence
- They're incomplete (suggests the cultists were interrupted or plan to return)
- One sigil is distinctly different from the others—not an erasure mark, but something else

---

##### PUZZLE: The Cultist's Cipher

**Setup:** One of the carved sigils stands out. Unlike the erasure marks (which hurt to look at), this one is clear and deliberate—three concentric circles with symbols inside.

**What the PCs See:**
- **Outer Ring:** Eight moon phase symbols (new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, last quarter, waning crescent)
- **Middle Ring:** Tide markers (high tide, ebb, low tide, flow) repeated twice
- **Inner Circle:** A single droplet symbol with an arrow carved through it

**Solving the Puzzle (requires PC deduction + skill checks):**

**Clue 1 - Moon Phase Orientation (Basic 2+ Perception or Scholar):**
- The **waning crescent** moon symbol (just before new moon) is carved deeper than others
- This matches the current phase—two days before new moon
- *Revelation:* "This tells us WHEN the ritual completes—at the new moon, when Aluneth's light is weakest."

**Clue 2 - Tide Pattern (Advanced 3+ Scholar/Priest or Sailor/Ranger with coastal knowledge):**
- The tide markers align with specific moon phases
- Following the pattern: new moon → high tide → ebb → low tide
- The low tide marker points to a specific direction relative to the shrine's position
- *Revelation:* "During low tide, certain marsh paths are passable. The cultists traveled during yesterday's low tide."

**Clue 3 - The Directional Arrow (Advanced 3+ Investigation + astronomical/navigational knowledge):**
- The arrow through the droplet points at an angle
- PCs must align the puzzle with the shrine's orientation
- **If PCs think to align the waning crescent symbol with actual moonrise direction (northwest this time of year):**
  - The arrow points **relative to the moon's position**
  - When properly oriented: arrow points northwest into the Greymist Marshes
- *Revelation:* "The arrow shows the way when aligned with tonight's moonrise—northwest, deep into the marshes."

**Full Solution Bonus (if all three clues solved, Expert 4+ cumulative difficulty):**
- **Distance Encoded:** Counting the symbols between the arrow and the marked moon phase = 8
  - Interpretation: "Eight... what? Furlongs? Hours of travel? Or maybe... eight markers along the path?"
  - (GM's choice, but suggests ~2-3 hours travel at 8 furlongs/markers into marshes)
- **Additional Detail:** The droplet symbol with tide markers suggests the cultists' hideout is **near water but below normal water level** (a sunken structure)

**Skill Check Summary:**
- **Basic (2+):** Identify moon phase timing (when ritual completes)
- **Advanced (3+):** Decode tide pattern (when cultists traveled) OR determine directional arrow (where they went)
- **Expert (4+):** Full decode including distance and structural clue (sunken/flooded hideout)

**If PCs Struggle:** 
- Sister Elyra (if consulted) can provide context: *"Aluneth's faithful use moon and tide patterns for navigation. The cultists mock her by using her own symbols against her."*
- The torn Tide-Ledger pages show similar navigational notation (helps PCs recognize the pattern)

**Reward for Solving:**
- Clear direction to cultist hideout (no getting lost in marshes)
- Advance warning of flooded/sunken location (allows prep time)
- Timing insight (PCs know they have ~3 days until new moon)

---

**Expert (4+) Magic/Priest check:**
- The pool's corruption is magical, but **not permanent**—it's being maintained by something external
- The water is trying to cleanse itself but something is anchoring the corruption
- If the source is removed, Aluneth's influence will return naturally

**Paladin-Specific Moment:**
When the Paladin touches the corrupted pool, they feel a surge of divine connection:
- *The water is cold—so cold it burns. But beneath the oily darkness, you feel something: a current, faint but persistent, flowing against the corruption. Aluneth's presence hasn't been severed—only suppressed. The tides still call to her. She is not gone. Not yet.*

**The Paladin gains:** *Blessing of the Tide* (temporary divine boon while in this adventure)
- Once per session, may reroll all dice on a single check and take the better result
- When protecting an ally from harm, gain +1d6 to defensive checks

---

##### 3. Track the Memory Loss (Social/Investigation)

**Interviewing Villagers:**

**The Forgetful Fisher** - **Marin Tidecaller**
- Forgot the name of his boat (carved by his grandfather)
- Keeps asking his wife "When did we get married?" (married 15 years)
- *"It's like... there's a hole in my head where something important used to be."*

**The Confused Mother** - **Nelsa Greycurrent**
- Looked at her daughter (age 9) and didn't recognize her
- Memory returned after an hour, but now she's terrified to sleep
- *"What if I forget her again? What if next time it's permanent?"*

**The Altered Elder** - **Borin Salthand** (quest giver)
- Keeps recounting a naval battle he "fought in"—but his service records show he was a merchant sailor, never military
- Insists the memory is real
- *"It's like someone else's life is bleeding into mine."*

**Pattern Recognition (Advanced 3+ Investigation/Scholar):**
- All affected individuals visited the shrine in the last three days
- The memory loss is getting worse—started with minor confusion, now entire identities are fragmenting
- If the pattern continues, within 4-5 days, no one in Tidemark will remember the village exists

---

#### Scene 2: Into the Marshes

**Following the Tracks:**

The footprints lead northwest into the **Greymist Marshes**—a foggy, treacherous wetland. 

**Skill Challenge: Navigate the Marshes**
- **Goal:** Track the cultists to their hideout without getting lost
- **Requirements:** 3 cumulative successes (Ranger tracking, Combatant survival, Scholar navigation)
- **Difficulty:** Advanced (3+)
- **Failure Consequences:** 
  - Encounter hostile marsh creatures (Mire Wraiths - see below)
  - Arrive at hideout at disadvantage (cultists are alert)
  - Nightfall arrives, -1d6 to all Perception checks in darkness

**Encounter (Optional if Navigation Failed): Mire Wraiths**

**2 Mire Wraiths** (undead spirits bound to the marsh)
- **HD Pool:** 3d6 each
- **Proficiency:** 1
- **Attack - Draining Touch** (Basic, 2+): 2 successes, 1 HD damage + target loses 1 Resolve on failed Resolve check
- **Incorporeal:** Physical attacks require Advanced (3+) or magical weapon
- **Weakness:** Radiant damage (Priest spells, Paladin abilities) bypass Incorporeal

**Tactics:** Wraiths try to isolate targets, drain Resolve, then retreat into fog when wounded.

**Lore (if Scholar/Priest checks after combat):**
- Wraiths shouldn't be this far from deep marsh
-Something is drawing undead and void-touched creatures toward this area
- Nihilistic magic attracts entities that have "forgotten" life

---

#### Scene 3: The Sunken Hollow

**Discovery:**

After 2-3 hours of tracking (longer if they failed navigation), the party finds the cultist hideout:

**The Sunken Hollow** - A collapsed stone structure, half-buried in marsh water. Ancient (pre-dates Tidemark). A circular foundation like an old well or shrine, but the interior descends 20 feet below water level.

**Exterior Investigation:**

**Basic (2+) Perception:**
- Fresh footprints (multiple sets) leading into the structure
- Faint glow from below (sickly pale, like moonlight through oil)
- Sound of chanting (low, discordant, unsettling)

**Advanced (3+) Scholar/History:**
- The structure is OLD—possibly from the Age of Naming (before the First Sowing)
- Original purpose: a **memory well**, where travelers would speak the names of the dead into the water so they'd be carried to Aluneth
- It's been corrupted—repurposed

**Descending Into the Hollow:**

A stone staircase spirals down into dark water. At the bottom (20 feet below surface), the space opens into a flooded chamber (30 feet across, water 4 feet deep, ceiling 8 feet high).

**What They Find:**

**5 Nihil Cultists** performing a ritual around a central **Void-Anchor Shard** (a jagged black crystal, 3 feet tall, pulsing with anti-light).

**Cultists:**
- **4 Nihil Initiates** (Level 1)
  - HD Pool: 4d6 each
  - Proficiency: 1
  - **Attack - Void Touch** (Basic, 2+): 2 successes, 1 HD damage
  - **Forgetting Curse** (Advanced 3+, once per cultist): Target must make Resolve check or forget one recent ally (treat as stranger for 1 hour)
  
- **1 Nihil Voidcaller** (Level 2, Leader)
  - HD Pool: 8d6
  - Proficiency: 2
  - **Attack - Erasure Bolt** (Advanced 3+): 3 successes, 2 HD necrotic damage, ignores armor
  - **Mass Forgetting** (Expert 4+, Ritual, requires concentration): All enemies in 15 yards make Resolve check or lose memory of current combat (forget why they're fighting for 1 round)
  - **Void Shield:** First attack against Voidcaller each round has disadvantage

**The Void-Anchor Shard:**
- The source of the shrine's corruption
- Actively radiating anti-memory energy
- **Can be destroyed** (requires 10 HD damage) or **sealed** (Priest/Paladin ritual, Expert 4+, 1 minute)
- If destroyed violently, cultists take 2 HD psychic damage each

**Combat Tactics:**
- Initiates try to curse PCs with Forgetting (turn allies against each other)
- Voidcaller stays back, uses Erasure Bolt, maintains Void Shield
- If Voidcaller drops below 3 HD, attempts Mass Forgetting (desperation move)
- If 3+ cultists drop, remaining flee deeper into marshes

---

#### Session 1 Resolution

**Victory Outcomes:**

**If Void-Anchor is Destroyed/Sealed:**
- Stillwater Shrine's pool immediately begins to clear
- Villagers' memories start to stabilize (though some gaps remain)
- Aluneth's presence returns to the region
- Sister Elyra regains full Resolve overnight

**Interrogating Cultists (if any captured):**
- *"We serve the Veil Beyond—the truth before existence."*
- *"Your Goddess clings to memory. Memory is chains. We bring mercy—erasure."*
- *"This was only the first anchor. The ritual has already begun. When the new moon rises, the **Moonless Covenant** will complete. Aluneth will forget herself. And the sea will follow."*

**Critical Information Revealed:**
- The Sunken Hollow was **the first of three anchor points**
- Two more Void-Anchors exist, forming a triangular pattern around Tidemark
- At the new moon (3 days from now), if all three are active, the cultists will complete a **ritual of erasure** that will sever Aluneth's connection to this entire region permanently
- The other two anchors are hidden at:
  - **The Forgotten Lighthouse** (northeast, abandoned 80 years ago)
  - **The Drowned Chapel** (west, underwater ruins)

**Paladin's Vision (that night):**

When the Paladin sleeps, they return to the ocean depths:
*Aluneth is less burdened now. One tendril has broken. But two more remain, tightening. She looks at you again, and this time you understand: time is short. The new moon approaches. When her light is dimmest, she is most vulnerable.*

*"Two wounds remain, little champion. Find them. Sever them. Or I will forget the tides. And the tides will forget the shore."*

**Session 1 Ends With:**
- One anchor destroyed
- Two anchors remaining
- 3 days until new moon
- A race against time

---

### Session 2: The Forgotten Lighthouse
**Level 1-2 - Exploration & Puzzle-Solving**

#### Opening: Planning & Preparation

The party returns to Tidemark. News of their success spreads. Borin Salthand offers the village's limited resources:
- **Healing:** Sister Elyra (restored Resolve) can prepare healing rituals
- **Supplies:** Villagers provide rations, rope, torches, one healing potion
- **Information:** Old fishermen recall stories about both locations

**Two Paths Forward:**

The party must choose which anchor to pursue next (both must be cleared before session end):
1. **The Forgotten Lighthouse** (easier to reach, more environmental puzzle)
2. **The Drowned Chapel** (underwater, requires preparation, more combat)

Most parties choose the lighthouse first. Statistics for both are provided.

---

#### Location 1: The Forgotten Lighthouse

**Journey:** 3-hour trek northeast along rocky coastline. Requires Basic (2+) navigation checks or risk difficult terrain.

**Description:**

The lighthouse sits on a jagged promontory, battered by waves. It's been abandoned for 80 years—officially because of "unstable foundations." Locally, people say it's haunted. No one remembers what it was called. Fishermen avoid this stretch of coast.

The 60-foot stone tower tilts slightly seaward. Windows are dark. The lantern room at the top is shattered. The door hangs open.

**Environmental Hazard:** 
- Unstable floors (Advanced 3+ Acrobatics/Awareness to avoid)
- Falling through rotten wood deals 2 HD damage
- Loud noises risk structural collapse

---

**Ground Floor:**

- Empty, rotted furniture
- **Basic (2+) Perception:** Wet footprints leading upstairs (recent, barefoot, cultist tracks)
- **Advanced (3+) Investigation:** Architectural plans carved into wall—building was deliberately constructed over an older shrine foundation

**Encounter: Memory Echo**

A translucent figure appears—**The Last Keeper**, residual spiritual echo of the lighthouse keeper who died here.

- Non-hostile (initially)
- Repeats the same motion: lighting a lantern that isn't there, looking out a window, then screaming and vanishing
- **Advanced (3+) Priest/Scholar check:** This is a memory loop—the keeper's death moment, trapped and repeating
- **Expert (4+) Social/Influence:** Communicate with the echo; learn the keeper died trying to *stop* cultists 80 years ago (the Nihil Covenant is ancient, resurging now)

**If the party lights a torch/lantern in the correct spot, the echo smiles and fades peacefully.** (Optional good deed, no mechanical benefit)

---

**Second Floor:**

- Old keeper's quarters
- **Investigation reveals:** Journal (partially burned)
  - *"They came in the night. Said the lighthouse was built on sacred ground. Their ground. They wanted to 'return it to the void.' I won't let them. The light must stand."*
  - Final entry: *"I can hear them below. Chanting. I can't remember why I'm here. What was I protecting?"*

**Spiral Staircase to Third Floor:** 

- Heavily damaged
- Requires Advanced (3+) Athletics/Acrobatics to climb safely
- Failure = fall, 2 HD damage

---

**Third Floor - The Lantern Room (BOSS ARENA):**

**The Chamber:**
- Circular, 30 feet diameter
- Open to sky (shattered roof)
- Storm wind howls through (disadvantage on ranged attacks)
- At center: **Void-Anchor Shard #2** (identical to first)
- Defending it: **3 Nihil Cultists** + **1 Void Construct**

**Enemies:**

**3 Nihil Fanatics** (Level 1-2, Elite)
- HD Pool: 6d6 each
- Proficiency: 2
- **Attack - Void Dagger** (Basic 2+): 2 successes, 2 HD damage
- **Fanatic's Zeal:** When reduced below 3 HD, gain one free attack (desperation strike)

**1 Void Construct** (Summoned Entity)
- HD Pool: 10d6
- Proficiency: 1
- **Attack - Crushing Void** (Advanced 3+): 3 successes, 3 HD damage, knocks target prone
- **Void Form:** Resistant to non-magical damage (half damage)
- **Anchor Tether:** If Void-Anchor is destroyed, Construct takes 5 HD damage and becomes Weakened (disadvantage on all checks)

**Environmental Tactics:**
- Wind: Ranged attacks at disadvantage unless sheltered
- Unstable floor: Area near west wall is weak—**Basic (2+) Engineering/Perception** to notice. If 2+ combatants stand there, floor collapses (10-foot fall into second floor, 2 HD damage)
- Anchor Manipulation: PCs can attempt to destroy anchor **during combat** (requires full action, Attack check vs. object, 10 HD to break)

**Combat Flow:**
1. Cultists position around Anchor, try to prevent PC access
2. Void Construct guards Anchor directly, uses Crushing Void to knock PCs away
3. If PCs focus on Anchor, cultists get free attacks
4. If Anchor breaks mid-combat, Construct weakens dramatically (easy cleanup)

---

**Lighthouse Resolution:**

**If Void-Anchor #2 is Destroyed:**
- The lighthouse groans, stabilizes slightly (as if remembering its purpose)
- The Memory Echo of the Last Keeper appears one final time, salutes, and fades peacefully
- Moonlight breaks through clouds, illuminates the lantern room briefly
- PCs find: **Tide-Keeper's Pendant** (magical item—wearer can breathe underwater for 1 hour/day, attunes to Aluneth)

**Paladin Moment:**
When the Anchor breaks, the Paladin feels Aluneth's relief:
*Weight lifts. The second tendril snaps. You sense gratitude—vast and ancient and patient as the tide itself. But urgency remains. One more. One more anchor stands.*

---

#### Location 2: The Drowned Chapel

**Journey:** 2-hour boat ride west, then dive 30 feet underwater to flooded ruins.

**Preparation Phase:**

PCs need a way to breathe underwater:
- **Tide-Keeper's Pendant** (if found at lighthouse) grants 1 hour underwater breathing to one PC
- **Herbalist's Aid:** Sister Elyra can brew **Water-Breathing Elixirs** (1 hour each, requires 2 hours preparation + Basic 2+ Alchemy check, can make 3 doses)
- **Ranger/Druid Magic:** If party has access to water-breathing spells
- **Hold Your Breath:** Without aid, PCs can hold breath for [Proficiency + 2] minutes before making Resolve checks

**The Dive:**

Ruins of an old chapel rest on the seabed, half-buried in silt. Gothic arches jut from sand. Stained glass (miraculously intact) glows faintly with bioluminescence.

**Underwater Navigation:**
- Limited visibility (30 feet)
- Swift current (requires Basic 2+ Athletics to swim against)
- Eerie silence broken by distant whale-song

**Encounter: Guardian Spirits**

**2 Spectral Guardians** (ancient protectors, now corrupted)
- HD Pool: 5d6 each
- Proficiency: 2
- **Attack - Spectral Blade** (Advanced 3+): 3 successes, 2 HD radiant damage
- **Corrupted Oath:** Once zealous protectors of Aluneth, now bound to the Nihil Covenant's will
- **Redemption Path:** If Paladin uses *Blessing of the Tide* and succeeds on Expert (4+) Influence check, Guardians remember their true purpose and **turn on the cultists instead**

**Chapel Interior:**

- Main hall (40x60 feet, vaulted ceiling 20 feet high)
- Altar at far end with **Void-Anchor Shard #3**
- **4 Nihil Cultists** maintaining ritual
- Murals on walls depict Aluneth's blessings—now defaced

**Final Encounter:**

**4 Nihil Wavebinders** (Level 2, Casters)
- HD Pool: 6d6 each
- Proficiency: 2
- **Attack - Void Torrent** (Advanced 3+): 3 successes, 2 HD damage in a line
- **Drowning Curse** (Expert 4+): Target makes Resolve check or begins drowning (loses 1 HD per round until death or curse broken)
- **Ritual Focus:** If 2+ Wavebinders maintain concentration for 3 rounds, they complete the Moonless Covenant early (bad ending trigger)

**High-Stakes Combat:**
- PCs fight underwater (movement halved, melee disadvantage unless using piercing/slashing weapons)
- Cultists try to complete ritual while fighting
- If Spectral Guardians redeemed, they aid PCs (advantage on first attack)
- Destroying Anchor breaks cultist concentration, ends Drowning Curses

**Environmental Advantage:**
- **Advanced (3+) Scholar/Engineering:** Notice load-bearing pillar is cracked—3 HD damage causes partial ceiling collapse on cultist side (2 HD to all enemies in area)

---

**Chapel Resolution:**

**If All Three Anchors Destroyed:**

When the third Anchor shatters, the effect is immediate and dramatic:

- Water around the chapel **surges** with radiant light
- Corrupted murals repair themselves
- Spectral Guardians (if redeemed) bow and fade peacefully
- A **translucent image of Aluneth** appears briefly in the water—a massive eye opening, seeing the PCs, and *knowing them*
- PCs feel overwhelming divine presence: **recognition and blessing**

**Paladin's Reward:**
- Aluneth grants permanent divine boon: **Memory of the Tide**
  - 1/day, may impose disadvantage on one enemy's attack by invoking Aluneth's name
  - Advantage on all checks related to memory, history, or resisting mind-affecting magic
  - Can sense when someone is lying about the past

**Party Reward:**
- **Aluneth's Favor** (divine blessing to entire party)
  - Each PC gains +1 to maximum Resolve permanently
  - Village of Tidemark will always offer sanctuary

---

**Session 2 Ends With:**
- All three anchors destroyed
- Aluneth's power restored locally
- But cultists are still at large
- The **Nihil Voidcaller Supreme** (cult leader) has not appeared yet
- One session remains to stop the cult permanently

---

### Session 3: The Veil's Edge
**Level 2 - Confrontation & Resolution**

#### Opening: The Cult Strikes Back

The party returns to Tidemark victorious. Sister Elyra confirms Aluneth's presence has fully returned—the tidal pool gleams silver under the moon.

**But that night, something happens.**

**Nightmare Vision (All PCs, especially Paladin):**

*You stand in void. Not darkness—void. Absence of light, sound, sensation. You are alone. Have you always been alone? You try to remember your companions. Their faces blur. Did you have companions? A voice speaks—not heard, but felt:*

*"Memory is chains. Identity is prison. We offer mercy. We offer silence. We offer the end of becoming."*

*Then: a location flashes in your mind. The **Veil's Edge Maw**—a sea cave five miles north where the coast cliffs meet deep ocean. The Nihil Covenant gathers there. And they're preparing one final ritual: not to erase Aluneth's presence locally, but to summon a **Void Herald**—an entity from the Veil Beyond that will unravel memory across the entire coast.*

**You wake, gasping. You remember everything. But the message is clear: the cult has escalated. They're summoning something catastrophic. And they're doing it tonight.**

---

#### Scene 1: Race Against Time

**Planning Phase:**

Borin Salthand musters what little the village can offer:
- **10 villager militia** (Level 0, 2 HD each, will defend Tidemark but can't join assault)
- **Sister Elyra** (offers to accompany, provides healing rituals)
- **Captain Threadwell** (fishing boat captain, can sail PCs to Veil's Edge)

**The Journey:**

- 1-hour sail along storm-battered coast
- **Weather:** Rising storm (the Veil Beyond touches this place, reality frays)
- **Skill Challenge:** Navigate storm seas (Advanced 3+, requires 2 successes or boat damaged, -2 HD to all PCs from rough landing)

**Veil's Edge Maw:**

A massive sea cave carved into black cliffs. Entrance is 40 feet wide, ceiling 60 feet high at mouth. Waves crash violently. Inside, the cave extends 200 feet deep into the cliff.

**At the back: a ritual in progress.**

---

#### Scene 2: The Moonless Covenant (FINAL BATTLE)

**The Scene:**

The cave opens into a natural cathedral—ceiling lost in shadow, walls slick with bioluminescent algae. At the center, a ritual circle drawn in something that drinks light.

**20 Nihil Cultists** (mix of initiates and fanatics) chant in unison. At the circle's center stands **Veilspeaker Korith**, the **Nihil Voidcaller Supreme** (Level 3 Elite).

Above them, reality *tears*. A rift in space—a wound in the Mortal Weave through which absolute nothing pours. An entity beyond comprehension begins to manifest: the **Void Herald** (incomplete, still forming).

**Korith's Speech (if PCs don't immediately attack):**

*"Ah. The tide-touched arrive. You've delayed us, yes. Destroyed our anchors. But you misunderstand. The anchors were merely... preparation. Now we summon truth itself."*

*(Gestures to the rift)*

*"Behold the Veil Beyond—the silence before creation. It hungers. And we are its mercy. Your Goddess chains you with memory. 'Remember the past,' she says. 'Honor the dead.' But memory is suffering. The dead should be forgotten. The past should dissolve. We bring peace. We bring erasure."*

*(Looks directly at Paladin)*

*"Join us. Let go. Forget your oaths. Forget your name. Be free."*

**Paladin gets one chance to respond** (pure roleplay moment—their answer doesn't change mechanics, but it's thematic climax).

Then: **Initiative.**

**BOSS FIGHT: MULTI-STAGE ENCOUNTER**

**Stage 1: Cultist Horde + Veilspeaker**

**Enemies:**

**Veilspeaker Korith** (Level 3 Elite Boss)
- **HD Pool:** 20d6
- **Proficiency:** 3
- **Attacks:**
  - **Void Lance** (Advanced 3+): 3 successes, 3 HD necrotic damage, 20-yard range
  - **Mass Erasure** (Expert 4+, Recharge 5-6): All PCs in 20-yard radius make Resolve check or forget one random ability/spell for 3 rounds
  - **Rift Pulse** (Auto, once per round): At end of Korith's turn, void rift pulses—all creatures within 10 yards of rift take 1 HD psychic damage
- **Void Armor:** Damage resistance (half damage from non-magical sources)
- **Phase Two Trigger:** At 10 HD remaining, Korith channels the rift directly (see Stage 2)

**10 Nihil Fanatics** (minions)
- **HD Pool:** 4d6 each
- **Proficiency:** 1
- **Attack - Void Blade** (Basic 2+): 2 successes, 1 HD damage
- **Zealot's Sacrifice:** When reduced to 0 HD, explode in void energy (5-yard radius, all creatures take 1 HD damage)

**Mechanics:**
- Fanatics swarm PCs, try to separate them
- Korith stays near rift, casts Void Lance, uses Mass Erasure when PCs cluster
- Every round, the **Void Herald grows more solid** (narrative tension)
- After 5 rounds, if Herald fully manifests, it becomes an additional enemy (see below)

**Tactical Objectives for PCs:**
1. Kill/disable Korith to disrupt ritual
2. Destroy ritual circle to close rift (requires 5 HD focused damage to circle itself, interrupts summoning)
3. Survive fanatic swarm

---

**Stage 2: Desperate Channeling**

**Trigger:** Korith drops to 10 HD or below

**Korith's Action:**
*"No! We were so close! Herald—take my essence! Manifest!"*

Korith sacrifices themselves, channeling their life force into the rift. The Void Herald **completes manifestation**.

**The Void Herald** (Extraplanar Entity)
- **HD Pool:** 15d6 (starts at full)
- **Proficiency:** 2
- **Appearance:** A massive humanoid silhouette made of *absence*—not black, but void. Reality distorts around it.
- **Attacks:**
  - **Unraveling Touch** (Advanced 3+): 3 successes, 4 HD necrotic damage + target rolls Resolve check or loses 1 Resolve permanently (until long rest)
  - **Existence Void** (Expert 4+, AOE): 15-yard radius, all creatures take 3 HD psychic damage + must succeed Resolve check or become Stunned (cannot act next turn)
  - **Herald's Presence** (Passive): All PCs have disadvantage on Resolve checks while within 30 yards
- **Weakness:** Radiant damage (holy magic, Aluneth's blessing) deals double damage
- **Disruption:** If ritual circle is destroyed, Herald takes 5 HD immediately and loses resistance to damage

---

**Paladin's Climactic Moment:**

When the Void Herald manifests, the Paladin feels **Aluneth's full presence surge through them**:

*You are standing in the ocean again. But this time, you are not at the bottom. You stand on the surface, and Aluneth rises beside you—her shell vast as an island, her eyes ancient as memory itself. She speaks, and you HEAR:*

*"Champion. You have remembered when all else forgot. Now—REMIND THEM."*

**Mechanical Effect:**
The Paladin gains **Channel Divinity: Tide of Memory** (one-time use, this battle only):
- **Action:** Advanced (3+) check
- **Effect:** Call upon Aluneth's power. Radiant tidal wave erupts from Paladin (20-yard radius)
  - All allies in range: Heal 3 HD + remove one negative condition
  - All enemies in range: Take 4 HD radiant damage + must succeed Resolve check or become Feared (disadvantage on attacks for 2 rounds)
  - **Void Herald:** Takes 8 HD radiant damage (double due to weakness) + loses Herald's Presence passive for 3 rounds

**This is the Paladin's hero moment.** Describe it cinematically.

---

**Ending the Battle:**

**Victory Condition 1: Destroy the Void Herald**
- Reducing Herald to 0 HD causes it to collapse inward, sucked back through the rift
- Rift destabilizes and closes
- Reality stabilizes

**Victory Condition 2: Destroy the Ritual Circle**
- Requires 5 cumulative HD damage to the circle itself (PCs must specifically target it)
- When destroyed, rift snaps shut violently
- Void Herald takes 10 HD damage; if still alive, battles for 2 more rounds before rift's closure pulls it back

**Victory Condition 3: Close the Rift Manually**
- Priest/Paladin can attempt **Expert (4+) Ritual Magic check** (requires 2 rounds concentration, uninterrupted)
- Success: Rift seals permanently, Herald banished
- Failure: Rift remains open, Herald fully manifests

---

#### Resolution: When Memory Returns

**After Victory:**

The rift closes. The cave shudders. Moonlight breaks through storm clouds, flooding the cave with silver light.

**All PCs hear/feel Aluneth's voice** (not words, but understanding):
*"You have defended memory. Preserved continuity. The tides will remember you."*

**Mechanical Rewards:**

**All PCs Receive:**
- **Blessing of the Eternal Tide** (permanent)
  - Once per long rest, may reroll any failed check related to memory, history, or resisting mind-affecting effects
  - Advantage on social checks with followers of Aluneth or coastal communities
  - Can breathe underwater for 10 minutes/day

**Paladin Receives (additional):**
- **Title: Tidewarden** (divine rank within Aluneth's faith)
- **Radiant Weapon Blessing:** Their weapon becomes permanently magical, deals +1d6 radiant damage against undead/fiends/aberrations
- **Aluneth's Mark:** A glowing spiral shell tattoo appears on their palm—glows faintly under moonlight, recognized by all faithful as a champion of the goddess

**Treasure Found:**
- **Korith's Void-touched Robes:** Armor (Light), provides resistance to psychic damage, -1d6 to Stealth checks (unsettling appearance)
- **Rift Shard:** Small crystallized fragment of the void rift, can be sold to a sage for 500 silver *or* used as magical component for powerful ritual (GM's choice for future hook)
- **300 silver markers** (promised reward from Tidemark)
- **Cultist lore books** (Advanced 3+ Scholar checks reveal Nihil Covenant history—possible future adventure hooks)

---

### Epilogue: Tides of Gratitude

**Return to Tidemark:**

The village celebrates. Memory has been preserved. Aluneth's shrine is cleansed. Sister Elyra leads a ceremony at the restored tidal pool where villagers speak the names of loved ones lost to sea.

**That night, under the full moon, the Paladin is called to the shore alone.**

**Final Vision:**

*You stand knee-deep in calm water. The moon reflects perfectly on the surface. Then, impossibly, the water deepens beneath you—no, you're descending. Not drowning. Moving through ocean as if through air.*

*And there, vast and eternal, rests Aluneth. The Dragon Turtle. Her shell is mountains. Her eyes are the abyss. She regards you with something beyond mortal comprehension: recognition, gratitude, and expectation.*

*She does not speak. But you understand:*

*"You are mine now, little champion. Where memory is threatened, you will stand. Where the past is denied, you will remember. The tides called you. And you answered."*

*You surface gasping, alone on the beach. Your hand glows with the spiral shell mark. You are changed.*

**Campaign End.**

---

### Campaign Themes

**Memory vs. Oblivion:**
- The core conflict: preservation of the past vs. erasure of suffering
- PCs must decide: Is forgetting ever mercy? (moral complexity)

**Faith Under Pressure:**
- Paladin's faith is tested (does Aluneth truly care? why did she allow this?)
- Other PCs witness devoted faith in action

**Cosmic Horror (Light):**
- The Void Herald is terrifying but beatable
- Nihil Covenant's philosophy is understandable (even if wrong)
- Reality is fragile; existence requires active defense

---

**Session 6: The Cult's Remnants**
- Scattered Nihil cultists regroup, attempt revenge

- Transition to travel campaign, defending coastal shrines

**Session 8+: The Veil Beyond**

- High-level planar adventure
- Encounter other deities/cosmic forces

---

### Game Master Notes

**Running This Campaign:**

1. **Emphasize Atmosphere:** This is cosmic horror meets devotional fantasy. Use descriptions that make void/memory loss visceral and unsettling.

2. **Paladin Spotlight:** This campaign heavily features the Paladin PC. Ensure other players get moments too:
   - Ranger/Combatant: tracking, combat tactics
   - Scholar: lore, ritual disruption
   - Priest (if present): healing, supporting Paladin's faith
   - Weaver/Mage: magical solutions, countering void magic

3. **Time Pressure:** The 3-day countdown creates urgency. Remind players regularly: *"The new moon is X days away."*

4. **Moral Complexity:** The Nihil Covenant isn't pure evil—they genuinely believe erasure is mercy. Let PCs debate this. Maybe one PC sympathizes? (Roleplay gold)

5. **Failure States:**
   - If PCs fail to stop ritual: Tidemark *does* fade from existence (harsh but memorable)
   - If Paladin dies: Aluneth can resurrect them once (divine intervention), but at cost (permanent -1 to max HD or Resolve)
   - If TPK at final battle: Nihil Covenant completes summoning; region becomes "Forgotten Coast" (erasure spreads, sets up rescue/revenge campaign)

6. **Victory Variations:**
   - **Narrow Victory:** PCs win but Tidemark is damaged (some memories permanently lost, village smaller)
   - **Heroic Victory:** All objectives met, no casualties, Aluneth grants additional boon
   - **Pyrrhic Victory:** Cult stopped but at great cost (NPC deaths, PC permanent injury, shrine destroyed but can be rebuilt)

### Affinity Mechanics Spotlight

**This campaign tests:**

**Resolve System:**
- Void cultists drain Resolve through horror/mind-affecting attacks
- Memory loss causes Resolve damage
- Emphasizes mental/emotional stakes alongside physical

**Hit Dice Attrition:**
- Multiple encounters per session without rests
- Underwater combat limits recovery
- Forces resource management decisions

**Ritual Magic:**
- Priests can counter cult rituals
- Paladin uses divine channel abilities
- Magic is powerful but situational

**Social Encounters:**
- Investigating Tidemark requires Influence checks
- Interrogating cultists provides info
- Redeeming Spectral Guardians through diplomacy

**Environmental Combat:**
- Lighthouse (wind, unstable floors)
- Underwater chapel (drowning, visibility)
- Cave (ritual circle as secondary objective)

**Elite & Boss Combat:**
- Multi-stage boss fight (Korith → Void Herald)
- Boss actions affect battlefield (rift pulse)
- Multiple victory conditions (kill boss, destroy circle, close rift)

---

### Connections to Aeralon Cosmology

**This campaign ties into:**

**Aluneth's Role:**
- Only deity residing in Mortal Weave
- Her unique position makes her vulnerable to direct attack
- Memory/continuity as divine domain (explored through cultist threat)

**The Veil Beyond:**
- Introduced as tangible threat (not just cosmological concept)
- Entities from the Veil can be summoned (dangerous precedent)
- Nihil Covenant as mortals who worship pre-existence void

**Planar Interaction:**
- Demonstrates how outer forces press upon Mortal Weave
- Sets precedent for planar conflicts in future campaigns
- PCs experience direct divine contact (Aluneth's visions)

**Future Hooks:**
- Other deities notice PCs (Thalos of the Even Hand might test them, Aralys the Veilbearer might offer cryptic warnings)
- Nihil Covenant is ancient and widespread (potential recurring antagonist)
- Void Herald's partial manifestation may have left "scars" in reality (future dungeon/hazard)

---

## END OF CAMPAIGN

**Total Expected Runtime:** 8-10 hours (4-5 sessions at 2 hours each)

**Player Level Progression:**
- Start: Level 1
- After Session 1: Level 2
- After Session 3: Potential for Level 3 (GM discretion)

**Recommended Follow-Up Campaigns:**
- *The Elm Convocation* (nature/oath themes)
- *The Willow's Price* (death/grief themes)
- Or continue this storyline with expanded cultist threat

*May the tides carry you, and memory preserve your name.*
*—Sister Elyra, Tidewarden of Aluneth*
