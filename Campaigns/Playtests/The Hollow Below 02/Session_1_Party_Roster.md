## Character 1: Nyra Thornweave (Weaver, Level 1)

**Player:** [GM-Controlled Playtest]  
**Class:** Weaver *(The Curator Arcanum)*  
**Level:** 1 | **Proficiency:** 1 | **Hit Die:** d6

### Core Stats
- **Current HD:** 5d6 (5 HD available)
- **Current Resolve:** 5/5
- **Armor:** 2d6 (Light Armor - Reinforced Robes, defense layer)

### Defining Affinity
**Virtue:** **Shadow** *(Aralys the Veilbearer)* — *"Mercy through endings; witness final moments with compassion"*

Nyra understands that death is not cruelty but release. She believes in gentle transitions, honoring last words, ensuring the dying are not alone. Born in the Verdant Verge where life explodes without restraint, she learned that sometimes the kindest act is to ease passage rather than prolong suffering.

**Affinity Dice:**
- **Gain:** 1 Affinity Die when offering mercy to the dying, honoring the dead, or easing difficult transitions (max 1 per day at Prof 1)
- **Store:** Max 1 Affinity Die (Level 1)
- **Spend:** Add to any roll as bonus dice (do NOT burn HD on 1s—safe cosmic power)
- **Currently Stored:** 0

### Background & Personality

**Age:** Early 20s (half-elf - Verdant Verge native)  
**Appearance:** Pale skin with faint silver veins visible at temples, dark hair streaked with white (not from age—from her Affinity). Wears gray traveling robes with silver embroidery depicting moths and fallen leaves. Carries small memorial tokens from those she's helped pass.

**Personality:**
- **Quiet and contemplative** - Speaks softly, chooses words carefully
- **Compassionate toward suffering** - Will risk herself to ease another's pain
- **Curious about magic's structure** - Sees the Weave as beautiful patterns to understand
- **Gentle but not weak** - Mercy sometimes requires hard choices

**Background:**
Nyra grew up in a Verdant Verge settlement where the Bloom's excesses caused plants to grow so aggressively they suffocated buildings. She watched her grandmother—a healer—exhaust herself trying to save everyone, refusing to accept when treatments became torture. When her grandmother finally collapsed, Nyra held her hand and sang the songs Aralys' followers teach: *"Your work is done. Rest is earned. I witness your passing."*

She studied Weaving afterward, seeking to understand the patterns beneath reality—both to create and to gracefully unmake. She travels now, learning magic while offering final comfort to those far from home.

**Motivation for The Hollow Below:**
"Something was sealed for a reason. If it must be unsealed, let it be done with understanding, not greed. And if people die in those depths... they shouldn't die alone."

**Player:** [GM-Controlled Playtest]

**Level:** 1 | **Proficiency:** 1 | **Hit Die:** d8

### Core Stats
- **Current HD:** 5d8 (5 HD available)
- **Current Resolve:** 5/5
- **Armor:** 2d8 (Medium Armor - Hide + Bone Plates, defense layer)

### Defining Affinity
**Virtue:** **Renewal** *(Thymera, the Verdant-Mother)* — *"From endings, growth; from decay, new life; embrace cycles"*

Roots-Between-Stone believes that nothing is ever truly lost—only transformed. Forest fires feed saplings, rot becomes soil, predators cull weakness and strengthen herds. They see renewal everywhere and consider it sacred duty to ensure death becomes rebirth, not waste.

**Affinity Dice:**
- **Gain:** 1 Affinity Die when facilitating transformation, turning decay into growth, or completing natural cycles (max 1 per day at Prof 1)
- **Store:** Max 1 Affinity Die (Level 1)
- **Spend:** Add to any roll as bonus dice (do NOT burn HD on 1s—safe cosmic power)
- **Currently Stored:** 0

### Background & Personality

**Age:** Mid-30s (firbolg - Verdant Verge native)  
**Appearance:** Towering (8 feet), covered in moss-like fur that changes color with seasons, antlers adorned with living vines. Face painted with spirals representing cycles. Wears armor made from shed bark and bone from natural deaths (never killed for materials).

**Personality:**
- **Patient and thoughtful** - Thinks in seasons, not moments
- **Sees beauty in decay** - Rot is not ugliness but potential
- **Spiritually grounded** - Communes with nature spirits regularly
- **Fiercely protective of cycles** - Will oppose those who prevent natural progression

**Background:**
Roots-Between-Stone was born during the Withering's dominance in the Verdant Verge—when fruit fell endlessly and maturation was sacred. They learned from elder shamans that the Bloom and Withering aren't enemies but partners in an eternal dance. When the Tempest tried to disrupt this rhythm with chaotic instant-growth, Roots helped restore balance by composting the overflow and planting seeds properly.

They travel now, seeking places where cycles have been interrupted—where death doesn't feed life, where growth is blocked, where transformation is prevented.

**Motivation for The Hollow Below:**
"Something was buried that should have decayed. Something was sealed that should have fed new growth. This disrupts the cycle—and that cannot stand."

## Character 3: Kessa Ironvow (Combatant, Level 1)

**Player:** [GM-Controlled Playtest]  
**Class:** Combatant *(The Concordant Halls)*  
**Level:** 1 | **Proficiency:** 1 | **Hit Die:** d10

### Core Stats
- **Current HD:** 6d10 (5 base + 1 from Unyielding)
- **Current Resolve:** 5/5
- **Armor:** 2d8 (Medium Armor - Scale Mail, defense layer)

### Defining Affinity
**Virtue:** **Change** *(Zarun the Unshaped)* — *"I am not what I was; I choose what I become"*

Kessa believes that identity is fluid, transformation is freedom, and refusing to evolve is death. She walked away from her birth name, birth role, and birth expectations. Every scar, every battle, every choice reshapes her—and she embraces this.

**Affinity Dice:**
- **Gain:** 1 Affinity Die when refusing static identity, choosing transformation over comfort, or redefining yourself through action (max 1 per day at Prof 1)
- **Store:** Max 1 Affinity Die (Level 1)
- **Spend:** Add to any roll as bonus dice (do NOT burn HD on 1s—safe cosmic power)
- **Currently Stored:** 0

### Background & Personality

**Age:** Late 20s (human - Verdant Verge refugee)  
**Appearance:** Broad-shouldered, scarred from training and choice (ritual scars marking transformations), short-cropped hair dyed in rotating colors (currently copper-red). Wears practical armor with no insignia—refuses to be claimed by any banner. Eyes fierce and restless.

**Personality:**
- **Intensely driven** - Always becoming, never settled
- **Rejects permanence** - Sees static identity as cage
- **Fiercely independent** - Owes allegiance to no one
- **Provocative** - Challenges others to examine their own prisons

**Background:**
Kessa was born in a Verdant Verge settlement that worshipped the Bloom—where growth meant always more, always upward, always beautiful. She was trained to be a guardian of flower-temples, to embody grace and nurture.

She hated it.

When the Tempest surged and realities shifted overnight, she seized the chaos. She abandoned her temple robes, picked up fallen weapons, and taught herself to fight. She crossed into the Mortal Weave seeking places where transformation is choice, not compulsion.

She swore no oath to god or order—only to herself: *"I am not finished. I will never be finished."*

**Motivation for The Hollow Below:**
"Something down there has been locked in place for centuries. Either it breaks free and transforms, or it stays buried forever. I want to know which—and maybe help it choose."

**Why Join This Party:**
Will respect those who make hard choices and reject easy answers. Values strength but despises those who use it to enforce conformity.

---

**Player:** [GM-Controlled Playtest]  
**Class:** Ranger *(The Living Accord)*  
**Level:** 1 | **Proficiency:** 1 | **Hit Die:** d8

### Core Stats
- **Current HD:** 5d8 (5 HD available)
- **Current Resolve:** 5/5
- **Armor:** 2d6 (Light Armor - Leather with Reinforced Bracers, defense layer)

### Defining Affinity
**Virtue:** **Knowledge** *(The Curator Arcanum)* — *"Understanding through observation; wisdom through humility before the unknown"*

Elrik believes that knowledge is earned through patient study, that hubris blinds, and that the greatest discoveries come from admitting what you don't know. He catalogs everything—plants, creatures, ruins, stories—not to own but to preserve.

**Affinity Dice:**
- **Gain:** 1 Affinity Die when discovering new knowledge humbly, admitting ignorance to learn, or preserving endangered lore (max 1 per day at Prof 1)
- **Store:** Max 1 Affinity Die (Level 1)

### Background & Personality

**Age:** Early 30s (half-elf - raised in Mortal Weave, spent years in Verdant Verge)  
**Appearance:** Lean and weathered, ink-stained fingers from constant note-taking, carries multiple journals in waterproof cases. Wears practical leather with pockets for specimens. Eyes constantly observing, cataloging.

**Personality:**
- **Intensely curious** - Must understand how things work
- **Methodical** - Documents everything, tests before concluding
- **Humble** - Knows how much he doesn't know
- **Cautiously brave** - Will risk danger for knowledge, but prepares thoroughly

**Background:**
Elrik was an apprentice scholar in the Mortal Weave who became obsessed with the Verdant Verge's impossible ecology. How does life sustain unchecked growth? What are the Verdant Excesses, truly—gods, biomes, or something else? He spent five years embedded in Verge settlements, documenting the Bloom's rise, the Withering's fall, the Tempest's chaos.

He learned wilderness survival by necessity (scholarly curiosity doesn't feed you), and found he had aptitude for it. Rangers who knew the land's secrets taught him to read tracks, predict weather, weaponize terrain. He became something rare: a scholar-ranger who understands both theory and practice.

**Motivation for The Hollow Below:**
"Sealed chambers are archives waiting to be read. Whatever caused these tremors—it's knowledge trapped in stone. I need to understand it before someone destroys it out of fear."

- Kessa (reject all permanence) vs Elrik (preserve all knowledge)
- Nyra (ease suffering through endings) vs Roots (transform suffering into growth)
- Kessa's fierce independence vs group coordination needs

**Shared Ground:**
All four left the Verdant Verge seeking something the Bloom couldn't provide: understanding (Nyra, Elrik), balance (Roots), or freedom to choose (Kessa). All understand that growth without limits becomes prison.

## Playtest Notes

**Testing Focus:**
- Level 1 mechanics (lower HD pools, limited abilities)
- Path Board diversity (4 different Pillars represented)
- Trapped Below variant (cumulative attrition, no return to surface)
- Multi-domain spellcasting (Weaver's versatility)
- Affinity diversity (4 different cosmic alignments)

**Expected Challenges:**
- Lower HD pools create resource pressure faster
- No Level 3 abilities yet (War Cry only 1/rest, etc.)
- Trapped Below variant prevents Recover (only Rest available)
- Party must coordinate limited healing resources

**What This Tests That Playtest 01 Didn't:**
- Level 1 start (vs Level 2 start)
- Scholar's Method Path (knowledge focus)
- Shadow-Trained Path (stealth specialist)
- Unyielding Path (pure resilience)
- Shaman class (new to playtests)
- Weaver multi-domain versatility
- 4-person party (vs 3-person)
- Different Affinities (Renewal, Shadow, Change, Knowledge vs Guardian, Decay, Memory)
