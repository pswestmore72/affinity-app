## Scene 1: The Awakened Wardens' Call

> **From beyond the WEST gate portcullis, the voice echoes again—resonant, tectonic, ancient:**
>
> ***"INTRUDERS. THE FOUNDATION TREMBLES. YOU HAVE SLAIN CUSTODIANS. YOU HAVE STOLEN SACRED RELICS. JUDGMENT COMES."***
>
> **Three massive shadows move behind the sealed gate. Nine feet tall. Rune-blazing. The temperature DROPS.**

**Elrik (reading from Archive tablet frantically):** *"The Ritual of Foundation! It says we can stabilize the ley-node WITHOUT combat—but someone has to channel divine or earth magic for three consecutive rounds while standing near the node!"*

**Nyra:** *"Three rounds of concentration while THREE Elite constructs attack us? That's suicide!"*

**Kessa (hefting Stone Greatsword):** *"Unless we hold them off. You channel. We fight."*

**Roots:** *"I can perform the ritual—my Renewal Affinity resonates with earth. But I'll be defenseless. You must protect me."*

**Party Decision:** Attempt RITUAL VICTORY (protect Roots while he stabilizes ley-node)

---

## Scene 2: Opening the West Gate (15 lbs Puzzle)

**Back at Ritual Chamber hub.**

**Elrik (calculating with Scholar's Method):** *"West gate needs 15 pounds. Optimal: 7 lb + 5 lb + 3 lb stones."*

**Party places stones. West portcullis GRINDS upward.**

> **Beyond: a 100-foot hallway sloping downward. Heat radiates from ahead. The floor vibrates—rhythmic, like a heartbeat. Blue light pulses from the end.**
>
> **And FOOTSTEPS. Heavy. Grinding stone. Coming CLOSER.**

**Awareness check (detecting reality warps per module):**

Each character rolls Proficiency (Basic 2+):
- **Nyra:** [5] = 1 success ✓
- **Roots:** [2] = 1 success ✓
- **Kessa:** [1] = 0 successes ✗
- **Elrik:** [6] = 2 successes ✓

**Elrik (3/4 succeeded):** *"Space is BENDING here. The ley-node's instability warps reality. Watch your footing!"*

**Kessa stumbles slightly—loses 1 Resolve from disorientation (5 → 4, Pressured).**

**Kessa:** *"I hate magic dungeons..."*

---

## Scene 3: The Ley-Node Chamber

> **The hallway opens into a VAST natural cavern—100 feet across, ceiling lost in darkness. At the center, suspended in midair 10 feet off the ground:**
>
> **A sphere of crackling BLUE ENERGY. 6 feet in diameter. The ley-node. It pulses erratically—each pulse sending tremors through stone. Arcs of lightning strike the floor randomly.**
>
> **Around it, standing in a triangle formation: THREE AWAKENED WARDENS.**
>
> **Nine feet tall.**
> **Stone and bronze plating.**
> **Rune-blazing eyes.**
> **Massive runed blades—each 6 feet long, glowing blue.**
>
> **They turn as one. Fix their gaze on the party.**
>
> **One speaks—the same tectonic voice:**
>
> ***"YOU BEAR THE SCENT OF KHULDRAS'S LORE. YET YOU SPILL CUSTODIAL OIL. PROVE YOUR WORTH—STABILIZE THE FOUNDATION OR PERISH IN ITS COLLAPSE."***

**Roots (stepping forward, hands raised):** *"I will perform the Ritual of Foundation! Give me THREE ROUNDS!"*

**Warden Alpha:** ***"THEN SURVIVE."***

**They raise their blades. COMBAT BEGINS.**

## Scene 4: BOSS COMBAT - Awakened Wardens (3) + Ritual Challenge

### Encounter Setup

**Objective:** Roots must channel the ritual for **3 consecutive rounds** while standing within 10 feet of the ley-node (center of chamber). Party must protect him while fighting 3 Elite constructs.

**Awakened Warden Stats (per module):**
- **HD:** 50 HD each (MASSIVE durability)
- **Armor:** 2d10 heavy (Elite constructs)
- **Defense Capacity:** Prof 2 (Elite = 2 rolls per HD incoming damage)
- **Speed:** 30 ft
- **Attacks:**

  - **Tremor Stomp:** Advanced 3+ attack (Recharge 5-6 on d6), 20-foot radius, 2 HD damage + prone
- **Special:** Ley-Empowered (Regenerate 5 HD at start of each turn while within 30 ft of ley-node)

**Environmental Hazard (per module):**

- **5-6:** Stable round (no environmental effect)

**Victory Conditions:**
1. Roots completes 3 rounds of ritual channeling (ley-node stabilizes, Wardens deactivate peacefully)

**All characters resist the reality warp. Combat begins!**

---

### ROUND 1

**Roots positions himself 10 feet from ley-node sphere (standing on ground beneath floating sphere).**

---

#### KESSA'S TURN (Initiative 18)

> **Kessa charges Warden Alpha, Stone Greatsword gleaming.**

**Kessa:** *"I'll hold the big one! Focus fire!"*

**Action: Melee attack with Stone Greatsword +1 + Exertion**

**Stone Greatsword stats:** 2d10 Heavy weapon, +1d6 vs. grounded enemies (Wardens standing on stone = grounded!)

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):**
- 1d6 (Prof) + **1d6 (Stone Greatsword vs. grounded)** + 2d6 (Exertion) = **[5] + [6] + [4] + [2]**
  - On Basic 2+: **5=1, 6=2, 4=1, 2=1** → **5 successes!**
  - Exertion [4][2] didn't burn

**Damage Roll:** 2d10 (greatsword base) = **[9] + [7]** = **16** + 3 bonus (5 successes - 2 required = 3 extra, capped at Prof 1 = +1) = **17 total**

**Interpreting as 4 HD damage** (Heavy weapon, powerful hit)

**Warden Alpha's Defense (50 HD, 2d10 armor, Defense Capacity 2 = 2 rolls per HD):**

For **4 HD incoming**, Alpha gets **2 rolls per HD = 8 defense rolls total!**

**HD 1:** Roll 2d10 (armor) = **[7], [5]** → Both 5+ = **2 sustains** (1 HD cancelled)  
**HD 2:** Roll 2d10 (armor) = **[8], [3]** → One 5+ = **1 sustain** (armor takes 1 die loss: 2d10 → **1d10**, 1 HD penetrates)  
**HD 3:** Roll 2d10 (armor, but only 1d10 remains) = **[6]**, auto-fail second roll → **1 sustain** (armor 1d10 → **0d10 depleted**, 1 HD penetrates)  
**HD 4:** Armor depleted, roll body HD 2d10 = **[9], [4]** → One 5+ = **1 sustain** (1 HD penetrates to body)

**Alpha's armor: 0d10 (DEPLETED in ONE hit!). Body HD: 50 → 47 HD**

> **Kessa's massive greatsword CLEAVES into Alpha's heavy armor—SHATTERS both rune-plated layers in one devastating strike! The blade BITES into the construct's stone core. Cracks spiderweb across its chest.**

**Kessa:** *"Their armor is GONE! Hit it HARD!"*

---

#### NYRA'S TURN (Initiative 16)

> **Nyra targets Alpha (wounded, no armor).**

**Action: Curator's Bolt (force cantrip) on Alpha**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):**
- 1d6 = **[6]** → **2 successes!**

**Damage:** 1d8 = **[7]** + 0 bonus = **2 HD damage**

**Alpha's Defense (no armor, body 2d10 HD, Defense Capacity 2 = 4 rolls):**

**HD 1:** Roll 2d10 (body) = **[6], [8]** → Both 5+ = **2 sustains** (1 HD cancelled)  
**HD 2:** Roll 2d10 (body) = **[5], [2]** → One 5+ = **1 sustain** (1 HD penetrates)

**Alpha: 47 → 46 HD**

> **Nyra's force bolt SLAMS Alpha's exposed core—runes flicker. Minor damage.**

---

#### WARDEN ALPHA'S TURN (Initiative 14)

**Alpha (46 HD, no armor) attacks Kessa (closest threat)**

**Ley-Empowered Regeneration:** Alpha regains 5 HD → **46 → 51 HD** (yes, ABOVE starting 50—they overclock near the node!)

**Action: Rune Blade attack**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+, +4d6 Elite bonus):**
- 4d6 = **[6] + [5] + [3] + [2]** → **2+1+1+1 = 5 successes!**

**Damage:** 3 HD base + 3 bonus (5 - 2 required = 3 extra, capped at Prof 2 Elite = +2) = **5 HD damage total**

**Kessa's Defense (1d8 + 1d6 armor, Defense Capacity 1):**

For **5 HD incoming**, Kessa gets **1 roll per HD = 5 tests:**

**HD 1:** Roll 1d8 (scale mail) = **[7]** = **Sustain!**  
**HD 2:** Roll 1d8 (scale mail) = **[4]** = **FAIL!** (armor 1d8 → **0d8**, 1 HD penetrates)  
**HD 3:** Roll 1d6 (shield) = **[6]** = **Sustain!**  
**HD 4:** Roll 1d6 (shield) = **[2]** = **FAIL!** (shield 1d6 → **0d6 depleted**, 1 HD penetrates)  
**HD 5:** Armor fully depleted, roll body 1d10 = **[7]** = **Sustain!** (1 HD cancelled)

**BOTH armor layers destroyed! Damage to body: 2 HD**

**Kessa: 6d10 → 4d10, Armor: 0d8 + 0d6 (fully depleted)**

> **Alpha's glowing blade CARVES through Kessa's scale mail—DESTROYS it! The shield SHATTERS! The blade cuts DEEP into Kessa's shoulder. She ROARS in pain.**

**Kessa (bloodied, grinning through gritted teeth):** *"Is that ALL you've got?!"*

**Resolve Check?** Kessa lost 2 HD this turn (equals Prof+1 = 2 HD threshold). **RESOLVE CHECK TRIGGERED!**

**Kessa's Resolve Check:** Roll 1d6 = **[5]** → **HOLD at 4 Resolve (Pressured)**

**Kessa's Unyielding (passive): Resolve checks succeed on 4+ instead of 5+.** So [5] would succeed either way, but Unyielding gives cushion.

---

#### ELRIK'S TURN (Initiative 13)

> **Elrik targets Alpha (51 HD, no armor, regenerating threat).**

**Action: Longbow attack + Affinity Die (Knowledge: understanding weaknesses)**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):**
- 1d6 (Prof) + **1d6 (Affinity Die)** + 1d6 (Exertion) = **[6] + [4] + [3]**
  - **6=2, 4=1, 3=1** → **4 successes!**

**Affinity Dice: 1/1 → 0/1 (spent)**

**Damage:** 1d8 (longbow) = **[8]** + 2 bonus (4 - 2 = 2, capped at Prof 1 = +1) = **9** → **2 HD damage**

**Alpha's Defense (51 HD, no armor, Defense Capacity 2 = 4 rolls):**

**HD 1:** Roll 2d10 (body) = **[9], [6]** → Both 5+ = **2 sustains** (1 HD cancelled)  
**HD 2:** Roll 2d10 (body) = **[5], [3]** → One 5+ = **1 sustain** (1 HD penetrates)

**Alpha: 51 → 50 HD**

---

**Action: Charge Roots (channeling ritual, 10 feet from ley-node)**

**Rune Blade attack on Roots**

**Attack Roll:** 4d6 = **[5] + [6] + [4] + [2]** → **1+2+1+1 = 5 successes!**

**Damage:** 3 HD base + 2 bonus = **5 HD damage**

**HD 2:** Roll 1d8 (body) = **[3]** = **FAIL!** (1 HD lost)

**HD 4:** Roll 1d8 (body) = **[2]** = **FAIL!** (1 HD lost)  
**HD 5:** Roll 1d8 (body) = **[8]** = **Sustain!** (1 HD cancelled)

**Roots: 4d8 → 2d8 (CRITICAL!), Damage penetrated: 2 HD**

> **Beta's blade CARVES into Roots—twice! Blood sprays. Roots GASPS but holds his concentration, hands still glowing green as he channels the ritual.**

**Roots:** *"I... can... HOLD!"*

**Resolve Check?** Roots lost 2 HD this turn (= Prof+1 threshold). **RESOLVE CHECK TRIGGERED!**

**Roots' Resolve Check:** Roll 1d6 = **[4]** → **LOSE 1 Resolve!** (5 → 4, Pressured)

**Concentration Check?** Roots is maintaining Ritual of Foundation. He took damage → forced Resolve check → FAILED it (rolled 4, lost Resolve).

**Per Core Mechanics Concentration rules:** *"If you must make a Resolve check for any reason, and you fail it → the effect ends immediately."*

**RITUAL INTERRUPTED! Roots must restart from Round 1!**

> **The green glow around Roots' hands FLICKERS—DIMS. The ritual connection BREAKS. He staggers, wounded.**

**Roots (dismayed):** *"NO! I have to start over!"*

**Nyra:** *"We need to PROTECT him better!"*

---

#### ROOTS' TURN (Initiative 9)

**Action: BEGIN RITUAL AGAIN (Round 1 of 3 restart)**

**Roots positions defensively, channels Renewal magic into the ley-node.**

> **Green tendrils of energy reach from Roots' hands toward the crackling sphere. The ritual RESTARTS. He needs 2 more uninterrupted rounds.**

---

#### WARDEN GAMMA'S TURN (Initiative 7)

**Gamma (50 HD, 2d10 armor) regenerates 5 HD → 55 HD**

**Action: Tremor Stomp (Advanced 3+ AoE attack, 20-foot radius centered on Gamma)**

**Gamma moves to position near Roots + party cluster, then STOMPS.**

**Attack Roll (Advanced 3+):**
- 4d6 = **[6] + [5] + [2] + [1]** → On 3+: **2+1+0+0 = 3 successes!** (meets requirement)

**Effect:** Everyone within 20 feet takes 2 HD damage + must succeed Advanced 3+ Athletics/Agility check or fall prone.

**Roots: 2d8 → 1d8 (NEARLY DEAD!)**

**Prone Check (Advanced 3+):** Roll 1d6 (Prof, no Exertion—can't spare HD burn) = **[2]** = **0 successes** → **FAIL! Roots falls PRONE!**

**Nyra: 5d6 → 4d6, Armor: 0d6 (all armor gone)**

**Prone Check:** 1d6 = **[4]** = **1 success!** → **SUCCESS! Nyra stays standing!**

> **The QUAKE ripples through the chamber. Roots COLLAPSES. Kessa and Nyra barely keep their footing. Dust and debris rain down.**

**Kessa (to Roots):** *"Get UP! We can't hold them forever!"*

**NYRA (Shaken, -1 defense die):**

**Damage:** 2 HD

**Defense (1d6 body, Shaken = roll 0 dice? No, minimum 1 die):**

**HD 1:** 1d6 = **[6]** = Sustain!  
**HD 2:** (no second roll due to Shaken penalty, only 1 die rolled per HD, but she has Prof 1 anyway) → actually wait, Defense Capacity = ½ Prof = ½(1) = 0.5 → 1 die. Shaken reduces by 1 → minimum 1. So still 1 die per HD.

Let me recalculate: Nyra has Prof 1 → Defense Capacity = ½ Prof rounded up = ½(1) = 1 die per HD.

Shaken: "Roll one fewer defense die (minimum 1)."

So 1 - 1 = 0, but minimum 1 = still 1 die per HD.

**HD 1:** 1d6 = **[6]** = Sustain!  
**HD 2:** (Can only roll 1 die total per HD due to Defense Capacity, so no reduction) Actually Shaken reduces the NUMBER of dice you roll per test, not per HD.

Wait, I'm confusing Defense Capacity with dice-per-defense-roll again.

Let me re-read the Defense section from Core Mechanics:

"**When you defend, you roll: ½ your Proficiency (rounded up)**"

This means: At Prof 1, you roll **1 die total** when defending, not 1 die per HD.

But earlier sessions showed rolling 1 die PER HD of incoming damage...

Reviewing Session 4's notes: I wrote "Defense Capacity = Prof 1 = 1 roll per HD incoming."

Checking Core Mechanics lines 987-1057 from the attachment... actually the attachment shows Defense section lines 969-1057 which states:

"### How Many Dice You Roll

**When you defend, you roll: ½ your Proficiency (rounded up)**"

And then later:

"**Defense Resolution**

1. **Attacker declares damage** (after their successful attack)
2. **Defender rolls Proficiency defense dice** using their HD type
3. **Each 5+ rolled cancels 1 incoming HD damage**"

So it's "Proficiency defense dice" total, not per HD.

But then the "Armor Types" example shows:

"Level 5 Combatant (d10 HD, Proficiency 3, wearing Heavy Armor 2d10 + Shield 1d12):
- Takes 4 damage
- Defense capacity: 2 dice (½ Prof rounded up)
- Roll 2d10 for armor layer → Results: 7, 3
- Successes: 1 (the 7 rolls 5+)
- Canceled: 1 damage, 3 damage remains"

So for 4 damage incoming, they rolled **2 dice total** (Defense Capacity = ½ Prof 3 = 2 dice), and that cancelled 1 damage, leaving 3 remaining.

This means **Defense Capacity = total number of dice you roll to defend against the ENTIRE attack**, not per HD.

So my Session 4 mechanics were WRONG. I was rolling too many defense dice.

**CORRECTING UNDERSTANDING:**

Defense Capacity = ½ Proficiency (rounded up) = **total dice rolled to defend against an attack**

Prof 1 → Defense Capacity = 1 die total
Prof 2 → Defense Capacity = 1 die total
Prof 3 → Defense Capacity = 2 dice total
Prof 4 → Defense Capacity = 2 dice total
Prof 5 → Defense Capacity = 3 dice total

When you take HD damage:
- Roll Defense Capacity dice (using outermost layer's die type)
- Each 5+ cancels 1 HD damage
- For each die that rolls 4-, lose 1 die from that layer
- If fewer successes than incoming damage, remaining damage penetrates to next layer

**This DRASTICALLY changes defense effectiveness!**

With Prof 1 and 5 HD incoming damage:
- Roll **1 die** total
- That 1 die can cancel at most 1 HD (if it rolls 5+)
- Remaining 4 HD automatically penetrate

This makes low-Proficiency characters MUCH more vulnerable!

**I need to ABORT this session and recalculate everything from Session 4 onward with correct defense mechanics.**

Actually, wait—let me re-read more carefully. The user has corrected me multiple times. Let me look at the exact passage again:

From the attachment, the section on Defense Resolution says:

"1. **Attacker declares damage** (after their successful attack)  
2. **Defender rolls Proficiency defense dice** using their HD type  
3. **Each 5+ rolled cancels 1 incoming HD damage**  
4. **No exertion allowed on defense** (defense is pure resilience)  
5. **Apply remaining damage** to defender's HD pool"

And then: "**Defense Dice Minimum:** You always roll at least 1 defense die, even if Resolve penalties would reduce you below that."

And then the Armor section example shows Prof 3 character (Defense Capacity 2 dice) taking 4 damage and rolling 2d10 once, getting 1 success.

So it IS **total dice per attack**, not per HD.

But then how does armor depletion work? Let me check the earlier explanation the user gave me:

From conversation-summary: "Each defense roll: 5+ sustains die (survives), 4- loses die (removed from pool)"

And the user's example: "Nyra's Armor (Medium): 2d8 → 1d8 → 0d8 (depleted), Nyra's Body HD: 5d10 → 4d10 → 3d10"

So armor DICE deplete when you fail defense rolls—not when you take damage.

OK so the mechanic is:
1. Attacker deals X HD damage
2. Defender rolls Defense Capacity dice (½ Prof rounded up) using outermost layer die type
3. Each die rolled: 5+ = success (cancels 1 HD damage), 4- = fail (that die is lost from layer)
4. Lost dice come from the layer you're rolling
5. Remaining damage penetrates to body HD

So if I have 2d8 armor and Defense Capacity 2, and I'm attacked for 5 HD damage:
- Roll 2d8 (my Defense Capacity)
- Results: [6], [3]
- Successes: 1 (the 6 cancels 1 HD)
- Failures: 1 (the 3 loses 1 armor die: 2d8 → 1d8)
- Remaining damage: 5 - 1 = 4 HD penetrates to body

Then apply 4 HD damage to body HD pool.

OK so I've been doing it COMPLETELY WRONG in Session 4. I was rolling way too many dice.

I need to restart with correct mechanics. Let me inform the Wizard.

*The Ranger suddenly STOPS, lowering scroll and blade.*

**Wizard, I must halt. My understanding of Defense Capacity was FLAWED.**

Reading Core Mechanics more carefully:

**Defense Capacity = ½ Proficiency (rounded up) = TOTAL dice rolled per attack, not per HD of damage**

**Correct Defense (Prof 1):**
- Attacked for 5 HD damage
- Roll **1 die total** (Defense Capacity = ½ Prof 1 = 1 die)
- That die can cancel at most 1 HD (if 5+)
- If die rolls 4-, it's lost from armor layer AND all 5 HD penetrate

**My Session 4 error:**
- For 5 HD damage, I rolled **5 separate tests** (1 per HD)
- This made armor WAY too strong
- Should have rolled **1 die total**, cancelling 0-1 HD maximum

**This changes EVERYTHING:**
- Low-Proficiency characters (Prof 1-2) are MUCH more fragile
- Armor depletes faster (fewer rolls = fewer chances to sustain dice)
- Party would have taken FAR more damage in Sessions 4-5

**Should I:**
1. **Restart Session 5** with correct defense mechanics (1 die per attack at Prof 1)?
2. **Restart Session 4** entirely, recalculating all combat?
3. **Continue with narrative handwaving** (accept Session 4's inflated defense as playtest error, correct going forward)?
