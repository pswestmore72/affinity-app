# Proposed Resolve Mechanics Changes (Based on Session 3 Playtest)

## Issue Identified

**SHAKEN (Resolve 3) is too punishing at low levels.**

Current rule: "All actions require +1 additional success"

**Impact at Level 2 (Proficiency 1 = 1d6):**
- Basic actions: 83% → 17% success rate (drop of 66%)
- Advanced actions: 67% → 3% success rate (near-impossible)
- Players became combat-ineffective (Roots failed healing twice, Elrik fled)

**Root Cause:** The +1 success penalty scales INVERSELY with level:
- Low levels (1d6 Prof) = crippling
- High levels (5d6 Prof) = manageable

---

## Proposed Solution: Graduated Resolve Penalties

### NEW Resolve Stages

**Resolve 5 — Full Strength**
- No penalties
- Peak performance

**Resolve 4 — Pressured**
- Cannot initiate Expert+ actions
- Weight of combat, but remain capable

**Resolve 3 — Shaken** *(ADJUSTED)*
- Cannot initiate Expert+ actions
- **Advanced+ actions require +1 additional success** (Basic actions unaffected)
- OR: **All defense rolls: -1 die (minimum 1)**
- Simpler choices become necessary

**Resolve 2 — Weakened**
- Cannot initiate Expert+ actions  
- **All actions require +1 additional success**
- **Defense rolls: -1 die** (minimum 1)
- Defense crumbles, actions falter

**Resolve 1 — Staggering**
- Cannot initiate Expert+ actions
- **All actions require +1 additional success**
- **Defense rolls: -2 dice** (minimum 1)
- "You should be running" stage

**Resolve 0 — Collapse**
- Fall unconscious immediately
- If HD > 0: Not dying, collapsed 0-2 days
- If HD = 0: Dying (Resolve checks each round)
- Death = BOTH 0 HD AND 0 Resolve

---

## Rationale for Changes

**Shaken Split Penalty (Choose One):**

### Option A: Advanced+ Only Penalty
- **Pro:** Keeps Basic actions functional (83% → stays 83%)
- **Pro:** Advanced actions (66% → 17%) still hard but achievable with Exertion
- **Pro:** Encourages tactical choices (fall back to Basic when Shaken)
- **Con:** Might be too lenient

### Option B: Defense Penalty Instead
- **Pro:** Doesn't affect action success rates
- **Pro:** Makes character vulnerable (lose 1 defense die)
- **Pro:** Creates risk without removing agency
- **Con:** Might not feel impactful enough

### Option C: Hybrid (RECOMMENDED)
- **Shaken:** Cannot use Expert+, **-1 defense die**
- **Weakened:** Cannot use Expert+, **-1 defense die, Advanced+ needs +1 success**
- **Staggering:** Cannot use Expert+, **-2 defense dice, Advanced+ needs +1 success**

This creates a **smooth degradation curve** where:
1. First you lose defensive capability (Shaken)
2. Then you lose offensive capability (Weakened)
3. Finally you're nearly helpless (Staggering)

## Alternative: Success Threshold Shift

Instead of "+1 success required," penalize the **success threshold**:

**Shaken:** All actions use **+1 threshold**
- Basic (2+) becomes (3+)
- Advanced (3+) becomes (4+)
- Expert (4+) becomes (5+)

**Impact:**
- Basic 2+ → 3+: 83% → 67% success rate (more manageable than 17%)
- Advanced 3+ → 4+: 67% → 50%
- Players can still function, just less reliably

**Pro:** Simpler math, easier to track
**Con:** Changes fundamental dice mechanics

## Recommendation for Playtesting

**Test Option C (Hybrid Graduated Penalties) next session:**

| Resolve | Penalty |
|---------|---------|
| 5 | None |
| 4 | No Expert+ actions |
| 3 | No Expert+, **-1 defense die** |
| 2 | No Expert+, **-1 defense die, Advanced+ needs +1 success** |
| 1 | No Expert+, **-2 defense dice, Advanced+ needs +1 success** |
| 0 | Unconscious/Dying |

This preserves **Basic action functionality at Shaken** (critical for low-level survival) while still creating meaningful pressure and risk.

## Additional Note: Magical Armor During Initiative

**ERROR FOUND:** In Sessions 1-3, Nyra cast Magical Armor during initiative.

**CORRECTION NEEDED:** Rituals take **minutes/hours** to cast, NOT 10-second rounds.

**Magical Armor must be cast BEFORE combat during prep phase only.**

This was correctly done in Session 3 (prep before descent), but should be noted for future sessions.

---

## Other Mechanical Corrections from Playtest

1. **Success Thresholds:** I ran everything as 5+ (Legendary). Should use tier-specific thresholds (Basic 2+, Advanced 3+, Expert 4+).

2. **Initiative:** Used d6. Should be **d20 + bonus d6s** from abilities.

3. **Exertion Emphasis:** Players should be reminded to EXERT on Advanced actions (that's the intended design).

4. **HD Rounding:** Session 3 had 25 HD total, not 27 (6+6+7+6=25).

*End of proposed changes. Awaiting Wizard's review and approval for implementation in Session 4.*
