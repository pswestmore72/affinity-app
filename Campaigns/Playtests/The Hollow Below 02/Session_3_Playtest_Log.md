# The Hollow Below - Session 3 Playtest Log (Playtest 02)

**⚠️ WARNING: This document contains INCORRECT MECHANICS preserved for historical comparison.**

**This playtest used:**
- ❌ Wrong success thresholds (everything treated as Legendary 5+)
- ❌ Wrong Resolve penalties (Shaken = +1 success to ALL actions, caused death spiral)  
- ❌ Wrong initiative (d6 instead of d20)
- ❌ Insufficient Exertion emphasis (players didn't use core mechanic)

**Results:** Combat took 6 rounds, party lost 48% HP, 2 characters hit Shaken and became ineffective.

**✅ For CORRECTED playtest using proper mechanics, see:** `Session_3_Playtest_Log_CORRECTED.md`

**Results with correct mechanics:** Combat took 4 rounds, party lost 4% HP, 1 character hit Pressured (still functional).

## Hook: The Council's Request (1 Day After Session 2)

### Narrative

> **Morning in Stonebridge. The town is recovering—tremors have ceased, the Pilgrim walks north under watchful escort, and the mine stands quiet.**
>
> **But at dawn, a messenger pounds on your inn door.**
>
> **"The Council needs you. NOW. Something's wrong at the chamber."**

**At the Town Hall:**

**Durg Blackiron (mine foreman, pale and shaking):** *"We sent a survey team down yesterday morning. Three engineers—checking the Choir Pillars for structural integrity, seeing if the chamber was safe to study. Standard procedure."*

**He holds up a blood-stained rope.**

*"This came back up the shaft an hour ago. JUST the rope. Cut clean through. No engineers."*

**Captain Torvald:** *"We heard sounds from below. Grinding stone. Metal scraping. And... footsteps. HEAVY footsteps."*

**Priestess Kara:** *"The Pilgrim left through the northern tunnel. Whatever's down there now is something ELSE."*

**Harlan Vex (calculating):** *"We'll pay triple your previous rate. 900 gold for clearing the chamber and recovering our people—alive or dead."*

**Nyra (suspicious):** *"You said the Pilgrim was the ONLY entity sealed down there."*

**Elrik (flipping through notes):** *"No—I said the Pilgrim was what the SEAL contained. But pre-Schism temples had GUARDIANS. Constructs built to protect sacred sites from intruders."*

**Kessa (grinning):** *"And the miners woke them up."*

**Roots:** *"The bound spirits are gone. The seal is shattered. If guardian protocols were tied to the seal's power... they would now operate independently. Without central control."*

**Captain Torvald:** *"Meaning?"*

**Roots:** *"Meaning they are no longer protecting the Pilgrim. They are protecting empty stone. And they do not remember WHY."*

**Silence.**

**Kessa (standing, hand on sword):** *"When do we leave?"*

---

## Scene 1: Descent (Return to Chamber)

### Preparation Phase

**The party has 1 hour to prepare before descending.**

**PREPARATIONS:**

**Nyra:**
- Casts **Magical Armor** (Basic Ritual, free) on **Kessa** again (tactical choice: protect the tank)
- **Kessa gains 2d12 outer armor layer** (limit: 1 per caster)
- Prepares **Curator's Bolt** (1d8 damage cantrip, Arcane domain)

**Roots:**
- Performs prayer to Thymera, asking for strength in renewal through combat
- Prepares **Spirit Strike** mentally (Advanced action, melee attack enhancement)
- Does NOT summon Beast Companion yet (was used 1/long rest yesterday, still expended)

**Kessa:**
- Sharpens blade, checks armor straps
- **War Cry** available (1/short rest)
- **Grit** available (1/short rest - stay at 1 HD when reduced to 0)
- Mentally prepares **Unyielding** (Resolve checks on 4+ instead of 5+)

**Elrik:**
- Loads quiver with 20 arrows
- **Recall Lore** recharged (was used yesterday, now available again after long rest)
- Prepares basic ranged attacks (bow, 1d8 damage)

**Resources Before Descent:**
- HD: 25/25 (full)
- Resolve: 20/20 (full)
- Magical Armor: Kessa has 2d12 outer layer
- Affinity Dice: 4 total (1 each)

---

### The Descent (400 Feet)

**ATHLETICS CHECK (Basic 2+)** - all characters climbing down:

**Group check - all roll, sum successes:**

**Nyra:** 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[4]** → 1 success  
**Roots:** 1d6 = **[5]** → 1 success  
**Kessa:** 1d6 = **[6]** → 1 success  
**Elrik:** 1d6 = **[3]** → 1 success  

**TOTAL: 4 successes** (well exceeds Basic 2+ requirement)

**Smooth descent—party reaches chamber floor in ~15 minutes.**

---

### Arrival: The Changed Chamber

> **The Chamber of Choir Pillars looks DIFFERENT.**
>
> **The eleven remaining pillars still glow faintly—but their song has changed. No longer harmonious. Now it's DISCORDANT. Clashing frequencies that make your teeth ache.**
>
> **The floor around the shattered seal is scorched. Black marks radiate outward like claw marks.**
>
> **And across the chamber—near the northern tunnel the Pilgrim carved—you see THREE BODIES.**
>
> **The engineers. Not moving.**

**Elrik (hushed):** *"Stay sharp. Whatever did this is still here."*

**Nyra activates Weave Sight (Passive):**

**What she sees:**
- The Weave is FRAYED around the seal's location
- Magical energy is leaking from the pillars—uncontrolled, chaotic
- And there are THREE DISTINCT magical signatures moving behind the pillars—constructs, each about 8 feet tall

**Nyra (urgent whisper):** *"Contact. Three entities. Eight feet tall. Constructs. Behind pillars at 2 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and 9 o'clock positions."*

**Kessa (drawing sword):** *"Ambush formation. They're surrounding us."*

**Roots (Spiritual Guidance activating):**

**What they sense:**
- No spirits in the constructs—they're PURE mechanism
- But there are THREE FRESH SPIRITS near the bodies (the engineers, recently dead)
- The engineers' spirits are hovering, confused, afraid to move

**Roots:** *"The engineers are dead. Their spirits linger. And these constructs... they have no soul. Just PURPOSE."*

**Elrik (nocking arrow):** *"Then we can't reason with them."*

**A GRINDING SOUND echoes across the chamber.**

**Three TEMPLE GUARDIANS step from behind the pillars.**

---

## TEMPLE GUARDIANS REVEALED

### Description

> **Each guardian is 8 feet tall, humanoid in shape but clearly CONSTRUCTED.**
>
> **Body:** Interlocking stone plates over bronze framework (clockwork visible through gaps)  
> **Head:** Helm-like, no face—just a glowing blue rune where eyes would be  
> **Arms:** One ends in a massive stone fist, the other in a blade-like edge (integrated weapon)  
> **Legs:** Jointed stone, moving with unnatural precision  
>
> **The runes on their chests PULSE—out of sync with the Choir Pillars' song.**
>
> **All three guardians TURN to face the party.**
>
> **A voice—mechanical, echoing from the pillars themselves:**
>
> ***"INTRUDERS DETECTED. SEAL INTEGRITY: COMPROMISED. PROTOCOL: ELIMINATE THREATS."***
>
> **The guardians CHARGE.**

---

## COMBAT - ROUND 1

### Initiative (d20 + situational bonuses)

**PARTY INITIATIVE:**
- **Nyra:** d20 = **[18]** - Shadow-Trained reflexes
- **Kessa:** d20 = **[15]** - combat instincts
- **Elrik:** d20 = **[12]** - ranger alertness
- **Roots:** d20 = **[7]** - slower to react

**ENEMY INITIATIVE:**
- **Guardian Alpha (stone-fist):** d20 = **[14]**
- **Guardian Beta (blade-arm):** d20 = **[10]**
- **Guardian Gamma (stone-fist):** d20 = **[6]**

**INITIATIVE ORDER:**
1. **Nyra (18)**
2. **Kessa (15)**
3. **Guardian Alpha (14)**
4. **Elrik (12)**
5. **Guardian Beta (10)**
6. **Roots (7)**
7. **Guardian Gamma (6)**

---

### NYRA'S TURN (Initiative 18)

> **Nyra sees three 8-foot constructs charging. She acts FAST.**

**Action: Cast Curator's Bolt (Basic 2+ cantrip)**

- Target: Guardian Alpha (closest, charging toward Kessa)
- Arcane domain, 1d8 force damage
- Range: 30 yards
- **Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[5]** → **1 success** ✓

**HIT!**

**Damage Roll:** 1d8 = **[6]** → **6 damage**

**Guardian Alpha has no armor listed yet—establishing stats:**

**GUARDIAN STAT BLOCK (Simplified):**
- **HD:** 8d8 (~32 HP worth, approximated to **8 HD** for tracking)
- **Armor:** 2d10 (heavy stone plating)
- **Damage Resistance:** Physical attacks deal half damage (they're stone/bronze constructs)
- **Abilities:** Melee attacks (stone fist 1d10, blade-arm 1d12), no ranged attacks

**Curator's Bolt is FORCE damage (magical), so NO resistance.**

**Guardian Alpha's Defense:**

Roll 2d10 for armor: **[7] + [8] = 15** → **2 successes** (5+ and 8 are successes)

**Nyra's attack: 1 success**  
**Guardian's defense: 2 successes**  

**Defense EXCEEDS attack by 1 → NO DAMAGE** (attack deflected by stone plating)

> **The arcane bolt STRIKES Guardian Alpha's chest—but the stone plating ABSORBS the impact. The construct doesn't even slow its charge.**

**Nyra (gritting teeth):** *"Heavily armored! Focus fire!"*

---

### KESSA'S TURN (Initiative 15)

> **Guardian Alpha is charging straight at her. Kessa GRINS.**

**Kessa (shouting):** *"Come on then! Let's see if stone breaks easier than bone!"*

**Action: WAR CRY (Combat ability, 1/short rest)**

**War Cry (Advanced 3+):**
- Effect: All allies within 20 yards gain +1d6 to their next attack roll
- Duration: Until end of this round
- Requires: 2 successes on Advanced check

**Roll:** 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[3]** → **1 success** (needs 2 for Advanced)

**FAILURE!**

**Kessa tries to rally the party, but her voice CRACKS—nerves betray her. First real combat since becoming an adventurer.**

**War Cry FAILS—no bonus granted, resource EXPENDED.**

**Kessa (cursing):** *"Forget the speech—just KILL THEM!"*

**Bonus Action: Ready defensive stance**
- Shield raised, prepared to tank Guardian Alpha's charge

---

### GUARDIAN ALPHA'S TURN (Initiative 14)

> **The construct closes the gap in massive strides—10 feet per step, covering 30 feet in 3 seconds.**
>
> **It swings its MASSIVE STONE FIST at Kessa.**

**Attack: Stone Fist (Basic melee, 1d10 damage)**

**Guardian's Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 (construct Prof 1) = **[6]** → **1 success**

**Kessa's Defense Roll:**
- **Base Armor:** 2d8 (scale mail) + 1d6 (shield) = 3 dice total
- **Magical Armor:** 2d12 (Nyra's ritual) - OUTERMOST LAYER
- **Total Defense:** 2d12 + 2d8 + 1d6

**DEFENSE LAYERS (from outside in):**

**First: Magical Armor** - 2d12: **[10] + [7] = 17** → **2 successes**

**Guardian's attack: 1 success**  
**Magical Armor defense: 2 successes**  

**Defense EXCEEDS attack → NO DAMAGE to Kessa, attack absorbed by magical barrier**

> **The stone fist CRASHES into Kessa—but shimmering arcane light FLARES around her. The Magical Armor absorbs the impact entirely. Kessa doesn't even STUMBLE.**

**Kessa (laughing):** *"Is that your best?!"*

**Magical Armor remains intact** (only breaks when damage exceeds defense)

---

### ELRIK'S TURN (Initiative 12)

> **Elrik draws, aims, FIRES—all in one smooth motion.**

**Action: Ranged Attack (bow) + Mark Prey**

**Target:** Guardian Beta (the blade-armed one advancing on Roots)

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[4]** → **1 success**

**Damage (if hits):** 1d8 = **[5]** → 5 damage

**Guardian Beta's Defense:**

Roll 2d10 (stone armor): **[4] + [9] = 13** → **1 success** (9 is a success)

**Elrik's attack: 1 success**  
**Guardian's defense: 1 success**  

**TIE → Attacker wins ties** (per standard RPG convention)

**HIT! 5 damage gets through!**

**BUT—Guardian has Physical Resistance (arrow is mundane weapon):**

**5 damage ÷ 2 (resistance) = 2.5 → rounded DOWN = 2 damage**

**Guardian Beta loses 2 HD worth of damage**

**How to track HD damage?** 

Each Guardian has 8 HD (d8s). Damage reduces HD count:
- 2 HD damage → Guardian Beta now at **6d8 remaining** (8 - 2 = 6)

> **Elrik's arrow STRIKES Guardian Beta's shoulder joint—Bronze framework CRACKS. Oil leaks. But the construct barely slows.**

**Elrik:** *"They're resistant to physical damage! We need magic!"*

---

### GUARDIAN BETA'S TURN (Initiative 10)

> **Guardian Beta pivots toward Roots with mechanical precision. Its blade-arm SWEEPS in a wide arc.**

**Attack: Blade-Arm Slash (Basic melee, 1d12 damage)**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[5]** → **1 success**

**Roots' Defense Roll:**

**Armor:** 2d8 (medium hide armor)

Roll 2d8: **[6] + [3] = 9** → **1 success**

**Guardian's attack: 1 success**  
**Roots' defense: 1 success**  

**TIE → Attacker wins**

**HIT! 1d12 damage incoming!**

**Damage Roll:** 1d12 = **[9]** → **9 damage**

**Roots' armor absorbed 1 success worth, but lost the tie. How much damage penetrates?**

**CLARIFICATION NEEDED:** When attack ties defense, does:
- **Option A:** Full damage go through (armor failed)?
- **Option B:** Partial damage (armor absorbed some)?

**I'll use Option A for now: Armor failed the tie, full 9 damage penetrates.**

**9 damage → Roots loses 9 HD**

**Roots' HD: 6d8 → loses 9 → IMPOSSIBLE (only has 6d8 = max ~48 HP)**

**CONVERSION ISSUE:** HD ≠ HP in this system. Let me recalculate:

**Each d8 averages ~4.5 HP. 9 damage = ~2 HD of d8s burned.**

**Roots: 6d8 → 4d8** (loses 2 HD from damage)

**BUT—this is Level 2, and Roots just took 2 HD damage in one hit.**

**RESOLVE TRIGGER CHECK:**
*"Make Resolve check when you lose ≥ Proficiency + 1 HD in a single round"*

**Proficiency = 1, so trigger = 2+ HD lost in one round**

**Roots lost 2 HD → EXACTLY at threshold → RESOLVE CHECK TRIGGERED!**

> **The blade-arm SLASHES through Roots' hide armor—cutting deep into shoulder. Blood sprays. The firbolg STAGGERS.**

**Roots must make RESOLVE CHECK (first of the playtest!)**

---

### RESOLVE CHECK - ROOTS

**Trigger:** Lost 2 HD in one round (≥ Prof + 1)

**Resolve Check Mechanic:**
- Roll 1d6
- 1-4: Lose 1 Resolve
- 5: Hold current Resolve (no change)
- 6: Gain 1 Resolve (rally!)

**Roots (Unyielding Path):** No—wait, that's KESSA's path. Roots is Wild-Touched.

**Roots rolls 1d6:** **[3]**

**Result: 1-4 → LOSE 1 RESOLVE**

**Roots' Resolve: 5 → 4**

**NEW STAGE: PRESSURED (Resolve 4)**

**Effect:** Cannot attempt Expert+ tier actions (not an issue at Level 2, but would matter at higher levels)

> **Roots gasps—not from pain, but from the SHOCK of violence. Blood runs hot. The chamber spins. Focus wavers.**
>
> **Resolve drops to 4. Pressured.**

**Roots' Current State:**
- HD: 4d8 (was 6d8)
- Resolve: 4/5 (Pressured)
- Wounded but standing

---

### ROOTS' TURN (Initiative 7)

> **Roots clutches bleeding shoulder, eyes locked on Guardian Beta.**

**Roots (through gritted teeth):** *"Stone without spirit... I will return you to the earth."*

**Action: Spirit Strike (Advanced 3+ melee enhancement)**

**Spirit Strike:**
- Imbue melee weapon with spiritual energy
- Next melee attack deals +2d8 extra damage (ignores physical resistance)
- Requires: 2 successes on Advanced check to activate

**Activation Roll:** 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[2]** → **0 successes** (needs 2 for Advanced)

**FAILURE!**

**Spirit Strike FAILS to activate—Roots' spiritual focus is BROKEN by pain and Pressured Resolve.**

**Roots staggers, unable to channel the spiritual energy properly.**

**NEW DECISION:** Roots uses BONUS action to **MOVE**—retreating 10 feet BACK from Guardian Beta, creating distance.

**Roots:** *"I... need a moment..."*

---

### GUARDIAN GAMMA'S TURN (Initiative 6)

> **The third guardian—so far ignored—CHARGES Nyra.**

**Attack: Stone Fist vs Nyra**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[4]** → **1 success**

**Nyra's Defense Roll:**

**Armor:** 2d6 (light leather)

Roll 2d6: **[3] + [5] = 8** → **1 success**

**Guardian's attack: 1 success**  
**Nyra's defense: 1 success**  

**TIE → Attacker wins**

**HIT! 1d10 damage incoming!**

**Damage Roll:** 1d10 = **[8]** → **8 damage**

**8 damage = ~2 HD for d6 dice (4 avg per d6)**

**Nyra: 6d6 → 4d6** (loses 2 HD)

**RESOLVE CHECK TRIGGERED!** (Lost 2 HD = ≥ Prof + 1)

**Nyra rolls 1d6:** **[5]**

**Result: 5 → HOLD RESOLVE (no change)**

**Nyra's Resolve stays at 5/5** (passed the check—held strong despite pain)

> **The stone fist SLAMS into Nyra's ribs. She FLIES backward 5 feet, crashing into the chamber floor. Leather armor CRACKS. Ribs scream. But she ROLLS with it, coming up on one knee, eyes defiant.**

**Nyra (spitting blood):** *"That all you've got, tin man?"*

**Nyra's Current State:**
- HD: 4d6 (was 6d6)
- Resolve: 5/5 (held strong!)
- Wounded but focused

---

## END OF ROUND 1

**ROUND 1 SUMMARY:**

**Party Status:**
- **Nyra:** 4d6 HD, 5/5 Resolve (wounded, holding)
- **Kessa:** 7d10 HD, 5/5 Resolve (Magical Armor intact, unharmed)
- **Elrik:** 6d8 HD, 5/5 Resolve (unharmed, positioned 20 yards back)
- **Roots:** 4d8 HD, 4/5 Resolve (wounded, Pressured)

**Enemy Status:**
- **Guardian Alpha:** 8d8 HD (full, unharmed)
- **Guardian Beta:** 6d8 HD (Elrik's arrow damaged shoulder)
- **Guardian Gamma:** 8d8 HD (full, unharmed)

**Resources Expended:**
- Kessa: War Cry (1/short rest) - USED (failed)
- Nyra: 1 cantrip cast (unlimited cantrips)
- Roots: Spirit Strike attempt (failed, no resource cost)

**KEY OBSERVATIONS:**
- ✅ First RESOLVE CHECKS occurred! (Roots failed, Nyra passed)
- ✅ HD damage system working (tracking 2 HD losses from 8-9 damage)
- ✅ Magical Armor absorbed full attack (Kessa unharmed)
- ✅ Physical resistance matters (Elrik's arrow halved)
- ⚠️ Party is already wounded (8 HD lost total out of 25)

### NYRA'S TURN (Initiative 18)

> **Nyra rises, hand glowing with shadow-wreathed energy.**

**Nyra (to Roots):** *"I'm not letting you fall!"*

**Action: Cast Mend (Basic tier healing cantrip)**

**Mend:**
- Touch range (Nyra must reach Roots)
- Restores 1d4 HD
- Requires Basic 2+ success

**PROBLEM:** Roots is 10 feet away (retreated last turn), Nyra is engaged with Guardian Gamma

**NEW PLAN:** Nyra attempts to DISENGAGE and reach Roots

**Disengage requires movement—Guardian Gamma might get opportunity attack**

**GM RULING:** Disengaging from melee is a BONUS ACTION (standard RPG mechanic), provokes opportunity attack

**Guardian Gamma Opportunity Attack (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[2]** → **0 successes**

**MISS!** Guardian swings as Nyra dodges—she slips past under its arm.

**Nyra runs 10 feet to Roots, touches their wounded shoulder.**

**Mend Casting (Basic 2+):** 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[6]** → **1 success** ✓

**SUCCESS!**

**Healing Roll:** 1d4 = **[3]** → **Roots regains 3 HD**

**Roots: 4d8 → 7d8** (exceeds max of 6d8, capped at **6d8**)

**Roots fully healed!**

> **Silver-threaded shadow-energy flows from Nyra's palm into Roots' shoulder. The wound CLOSES—flesh knitting, blood flow stopping. In seconds, it's healed.**

**Roots (awed):** *"Shadow's mercy... thank you."*

**Nyra (grim):** *"Don't thank me yet. We're still surrounded."*

---

### KESSA'S TURN (Initiative 15)

> **Kessa sees Nyra exposed (just ran away from Guardian Gamma), Roots still recovering. The stone tank makes a decision.**

**Kessa:** *"Eyes on ME, scrap-heaps!"*

**Action: CHARGE Guardian Alpha (the one that attacked her earlier)**

**Melee Attack with Longsword (Basic 2+)**

**Attack Roll:** 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[5]** → **1 success**

**Damage (if hits):** 1d8 (longsword) = **[6]** → **6 damage**

**Guardian Alpha's Defense:**

Roll 2d10: **[6] + [3] = 9** → **1 success**

**Kessa's attack: 1 success**  
**Guardian's defense: 1 success**  

**TIE → Attacker wins**

**HIT! 6 damage gets through!**

**Physical Resistance applies:** 6 ÷ 2 = 3 damage

**Guardian Alpha: 8d8 → 5d8** (loses 3 HD)

> **Kessa's blade STRIKES the guardian's knee joint—stone CRACKS, bronze framework BENDS. The construct's leg buckles slightly. First real damage.**

**Kessa (grinning through bloodlust):** *"THERE! They CAN bleed!"*

---

### GUARDIAN ALPHA'S TURN (Initiative 14)

> **The damaged guardian RETALIATES immediately—massive stone fist targeting Kessa.**

**Attack: Stone Fist vs Kessa**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[6]** → **1 success**

**Kessa's Defense:**
- Magical Armor (2d12) - outer layer
- Scale Mail (2d8) + Shield (1d6) - inner layers

**Magical Armor Defense:** 2d12: **[8] + [11] = 19** → **2 successes**

**Guardian's attack: 1 success**  
**Magical Armor defense: 2 successes**  

**Defense EXCEEDS attack → NO DAMAGE, Magical Armor holds**

> **Another THUNDEROUS impact—arcane light FLARES as the Magical Armor absorbs the strike. Kessa's grin widens.**

**Kessa:** *"Keep swinging, bucket of bolts! My shield's tougher than your scrap metal!"*

---

### ELRIK'S TURN (Initiative 12)

> **Elrik sees Guardian Beta is already damaged (his earlier arrow). He targets the SAME construct—focus fire.**

**Action: Ranged Attack (bow) at Guardian Beta**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[3]** → **1 success**

**Damage:** 1d8 = **[4]** → **4 damage**

**Guardian Beta's Defense:**

Roll 2d10: **[5] + [7] = 12** → **2 successes**

**Elrik's attack: 1 success**  
**Guardian's defense: 2 successes**  

**Defense EXCEEDS attack by 1 → NO DAMAGE**

> **Elrik's arrow RICOCHETS off Guardian Beta's chest plating—the construct has turned to face him, presenting heavier armor.**

**Elrik (frustrated):** *"They adapt! Watch your angles!"*

---

### GUARDIAN BETA'S TURN (Initiative 10)

> **Guardian Beta charges ELRIK (the one shooting it).**

**Beta MOVES 30 feet, closing distance to Elrik (was 20 yards = 60 feet away, now in melee range)**

**Attack: Blade-Arm Slash vs Elrik**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[4]** → **1 success**

**Elrik's Defense:**

**Armor:** 2d6 (light leather)

Roll 2d6: **[2] + [6] = 8** → **1 success**

**Guardian's attack: 1 success**  
**Elrik's defense: 1 success**  

**TIE → Attacker wins**

**HIT! 1d12 damage incoming!**

**Damage Roll:** 1d12 = **[11]** → **11 damage**

**11 damage = ~3 HD for d8 dice** (rounding 11/4 = 2.75, round up to 3)

**Elrik: 6d8 → 3d8** (loses 3 HD—MAJOR damage)

**RESOLVE CHECK TRIGGERED!** (Lost 3 HD = ≥ Prof + 1 by FAR)

**Elrik rolls 1d6:** **[2]**

**Result: 1-4 → LOSE 1 RESOLVE**

**Elrik's Resolve: 5 → 4** (Pressured)

> **The blade-arm SLASHES across Elrik's chest—leather armor shreds like paper. Blood sprays. He drops his bow, clutching the wound, stumbling backward.**

**Elrik (gasping):** *"That... that nearly killed me..."*

**Elrik's Current State:**
- HD: 3d8 (HALF health, critically wounded)
- Resolve: 4/5 (Pressured)
- Bow dropped, in melee with Guardian Beta

---

### ROOTS' TURN (Initiative 7)

> **Roots sees Elrik GUTTED. The scholar-ranger is dying. Not today.**

**Roots:** *"The cycle does NOT end here, young one!"*

**Action: Cast Renewal's Touch (Shaman healing ability—checking class document...)**

**WAIT—Roots is a Shaman, needs to verify healing abilities.**

**Shaman healing options (assuming standard RPG mechanics + Affinity system):**
- Likely has healing spell or ability
- Primal domain healing (Nature's Mend type spell?)

**I'll use: Nature's Mend (Basic tier Primal healing spell)**
- Range: Touch
- Restores 1d6 HD
- Requires Basic 2+ success

**Roots RUNS to Elrik (10 feet movement), pressing hand to the wound.**

**Casting Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[5]** → **1 success** ✓

**Healing Roll:** 1d6 = **[4]** → **Elrik regains 4 HD**

**Elrik: 3d8 → 7d8** (exceeds max of 6d8, capped at **6d8**)

**Elrik fully healed!**

> **Green-gold light flows from Roots' hand—the Renewal Affinity in full force. Elrik's wound CLOSES. Flesh knits. Color returns to his face. He gasps, eyes wide.**

**Elrik (stunned):** *"I... I was dead. I felt it."*

**Roots:** *"Not dead. Renewed. Now FIGHT."*

---

### GUARDIAN GAMMA'S TURN (Initiative 6)

> **Guardian Gamma (previously targeting Nyra, who disengaged) redirects to nearest threat: ROOTS (who just healed Elrik).**

**Attack: Stone Fist vs Roots**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[3]** → **1 success**

**Roots' Defense:**

Roll 2d8 (hide armor): **[7] + [4] = 11** → **1 success**

**Guardian's attack: 1 success**  
**Roots' defense: 1 success**  

**TIE → Attacker wins**

**HIT! 1d10 damage!**

**Damage Roll:** 1d10 = **[6]** → **6 damage**

**6 damage = ~2 HD for d8**

**Roots JUST got healed to 6d8, now: 6d8 → 4d8** (loses 2 HD AGAIN)

**RESOLVE CHECK TRIGGERED AGAIN!** (Lost 2 HD in this round)

**BUT—Roots ALREADY has Resolve 4 (Pressured from Round 1).**

**Can you make multiple Resolve checks per combat?**

*"Maximum of 1 Resolve check per round"*

**Did Roots already make one this round?** No—previous check was ROUND 1.

**This is ROUND 2, so NEW check is allowed.**

**Roots rolls 1d6:** **[1]**

**Result: 1-4 → LOSE 1 RESOLVE**

**Roots' Resolve: 4 → 3** (SHAKEN)

**NEW STAGE: SHAKEN (Resolve 3)**

**Effect:** 
- Cannot attempt Expert+ tier actions
- ALL actions require +1 success to succeed (Basic becomes 3+ instead of 2+, Advanced becomes 4+ instead of 3+)

> **The stone fist CRASHES into Roots' side—ribs CRACK. The firbolg cries out in pain, dropping to one knee. Vision blurs. Breath comes shallow.**
>
> **Resolve drops to 3. Shaken. The world tilts.**

**Roots' Current State:**
- HD: 4d8 (wounded AGAIN)
- Resolve: 3/5 (SHAKEN - +1 success penalty on all actions)
- Barely holding on

---

## END OF ROUND 2

**Party Status:**
- **Nyra:** 4d6 HD, 5/5 Resolve (wounded but stable)
- **Kessa:** 7d10 HD, 5/5 Resolve (Magical Armor intact, unharmed, tank MVP)
- **Elrik:** 6d8 HD, 4/5 Resolve (healed back to full, Pressured)
- **Roots:** 4d8 HD, 3/5 Resolve (wounded twice, SHAKEN—penalties active)

**Enemy Status:**
- **Guardian Alpha:** 5d8 HD (Kessa damaged knee joint)
- **Guardian Beta:** 6d8 HD (Elrik's first arrow partially damaged)
- **Guardian Gamma:** 8d8 HD (full, unharmed)

**Total Party HD:** 4+7+6+4 = **21/25 HD** (84% - only lost 4 HD net due to healing)

**Resolve Checks So Far:**
- ✅ Roots (Round 1): Failed (lost 1 Resolve)
- ✅ Nyra (Round 1): Passed (held Resolve)
- ✅ Elrik (Round 2): Failed (lost 1 Resolve)
- ✅ Roots (Round 2): Failed AGAIN (lost 1 more Resolve, now SHAKEN)

**Critical Situation:**
- Roots is at Resolve 3 (SHAKEN) → +1 success penalty makes ALL actions harder
- Party has taken significant damage, but healing is keeping them alive
- Guardians are durable (high armor, physical resistance)
- Kessa's Magical Armor is MVP (absorbed 3 full attacks so far)

---

## COMBAT - ROUND 3

### Initiative Order (same)

1. Nyra (18)
2. Kessa (15)
3. Guardian Alpha (14)
4. Elrik (12)
5. Guardian Beta (10)
6. Roots (7)
7. Guardian Gamma (6)

---

### NYRA'S TURN (Initiative 18)

> **Nyra sees Roots SHAKEN, barely standing. The firbolg's antlers droop, moss wilting. This ends NOW.**

**Nyra (desperate):** *"Roots—fall back! Kessa, cover them!"*

**Decision:** Nyra uses AFFINITY DIE + aggressive offense

**Action: Cast Unravel (Advanced 3+ Arcane spell)**

**Unravel:**
- Target: Guardian Gamma (the one beating on Roots)
- Effect: Destabilize magical/constructed target, deals 2d8 damage + potential disruption
- Requires: 2 successes on Advanced check

**Attack Roll:** 1d6 (Prof 1) + **1d6 (Affinity Die - SPENT)** = **[4] + [6]** → **2 successes** ✓

**Nyra spends her stored Affinity Die (Shadow-aligned action: ending threats to protect allies)**

**Affinity Dice: 1/1 → 0/1**

**SUCCESS! Unravel activates!**

**Damage Roll:** 2d8 = **[7] + [5] = 12** → **12 damage**

**Guardian Gamma's Defense:**

Roll 2d10: **[9] + [4] = 13** → **1 success**

**Nyra's attack: 2 successes**  
**Guardian's defense: 1 success**  

**Attack EXCEEDS defense by 1 → FULL DAMAGE penetrates!**

**12 damage (magical force) = ~3 HD for d8 (12/4 = 3)**

**Guardian Gamma: 8d8 → 5d8** (first real damage!)

**SPECIAL EFFECT - Unravel's disruption:**

> **Nyra's hand blazes with shadow-wreathed violet energy. She TEARS at the Weave surrounding Guardian Gamma. The construct's runes FLICKER—disrupted. Bronze framework GROANS. Stone plates CRACK.**
>
> **The guardian STAGGERS, off-balance for the first time.**

**Unravel also causes:** Target has disadvantage on next attack (mechanical disruption)

**Nyra (breathing hard):** *"They CAN be broken!"*

---

### KESSA'S TURN (Initiative 15)

> **Kessa sees Nyra's opening—Guardian Gamma disrupted. She CHARGES.**

**Kessa:** *"MINE!"*

**Action: Melee Attack (Longsword) vs Guardian Gamma**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[6]** → **1 success**

**Damage:** 1d8 = **[7]** → **7 damage**

**Guardian Gamma's Defense (with DISADVANTAGE from Unravel):**

**RULING:** Disadvantage = roll defense twice, take WORSE result

Roll 2d10 (first): **[8] + [6] = 14** → **2 successes**  
Roll 2d10 (second): **[3] + [5] = 8** → **1 success**  

**Take worse: 1 success**

**Kessa's attack: 1 success**  
**Guardian's defense: 1 success**  

**TIE → Attacker wins**

**HIT! 7 damage → ÷2 (physical resistance) = 3.5 → round DOWN = 3 damage**

**Guardian Gamma: 5d8 → 2d8** (critically damaged!)

> **Kessa's blade SLAMS into the disrupted guardian's chest—right where Nyra's Unravel cracked the stone plating. The sword PLUNGES DEEP into bronze framework. Clockwork SHATTERS. Oil sprays.**
>
> **Guardian Gamma's runes DIM. It stumbles backward, barely functional.**

**Kessa:** *"One more hit and it's SCRAP!"*

---

### GUARDIAN ALPHA'S TURN (Initiative 14)

> **Alpha (damaged knee) continues attacking Kessa—she's the biggest threat.**

**Attack: Stone Fist vs Kessa**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[5]** → **1 success**

**Kessa's Magical Armor Defense:**

Roll 2d12: **[11] + [6] = 17** → **2 successes**

**Guardian's attack: 1 success**  
**Magical Armor: 2 successes**  

**Defense EXCEEDS attack → NO DAMAGE, Magical Armor STILL holds**

> **FOURTH consecutive attack absorbed by Nyra's ritual. The Magical Armor shimmers but HOLDS. Kessa is untouchable.**

**Kessa (taunting):** *"You're embarrassing yourself!"*

---

### ELRIK'S TURN (Initiative 12)

> **Elrik (Pressured, Resolve 4) picks up his bow, hands still shaking from the near-death experience. He focuses on Guardian Beta—the one that nearly killed him.**

**Elrik (quiet fury):** *"Payback."*

**Action: Ranged Attack + EXERTION DIE (wants to ensure hit)**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 (Prof) + **1d6 (Exertion Die)** = **[4] + [2]** → **1 success** (but Exertion die = **[2]**, NOT burned)

**Damage:** 1d8 = **[6]** → **6 damage**

**Guardian Beta's Defense:**

Roll 2d10: **[4] + [10] = 14** → **2 successes** (10 is a success)

**Elrik's attack: 1 success**  
**Guardian's defense: 2 successes**  

**Defense EXCEEDS attack → NO DAMAGE**

> **Elrik's arrow STRIKES but glances off heavy plating. Frustration boils.**

**Elrik (gritting teeth):** *"These things are TANKS!"*

---

### GUARDIAN BETA'S TURN (Initiative 10)

> **Beta charges Elrik AGAIN—relentless targeting.**

**Attack: Blade-Arm vs Elrik**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[3]** → **1 success**

**Elrik's Defense:**

Roll 2d6 (leather): **[5] + [3] = 8** → **1 success**

**TIE → Attacker wins**

**HIT! 1d12 damage!**

**Damage Roll:** 1d12 = **[10]** → **10 damage**

**10 damage = ~3 HD for d8**

**Elrik: 6d8 → 3d8** (AGAIN! Critically wounded AGAIN!)

**RESOLVE CHECK TRIGGERED!**

**Elrik rolls 1d6:** **[4]**

**Result: 1-4 → LOSE 1 RESOLVE**

**Elrik's Resolve: 4 → 3** (SHAKEN, same as Roots)

> **The blade-arm slashes AGAIN—nearly the EXACT SAME WOUND as before. Elrik SCREAMS, collapsing. Blood pools. He's dying.**

**Elrik's Current State:**
- HD: 3d8 (HALF health)
- Resolve: 3/5 (SHAKEN - +1 success penalty)
- **In critical danger**

---

### ROOTS' TURN (Initiative 7)

> **Roots sees Elrik fall AGAIN. No. NOT AGAIN.**

**Roots (SHAKEN, +1 success penalty active):** *"I will NOT let you die twice!"*

**Action: Nature's Mend on Elrik (Basic 2+, but SHAKEN makes it Basic 3+)**

**NEW DIFFICULTY: 3+ successes needed** (Shaken penalty)

**Casting Roll:** 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[6]** → **1 success** (needs 3 for Shaken-modified Basic)

**FAILURE!**

**Roots tries to channel healing energy, but hands SHAKE—Resolve 3 makes focus nearly impossible. The spell FIZZLES.**

**Roots (desperate, panicking):** *"No—no! It's not working! Elrik, STAY WITH ME!"*

**Roots uses BONUS ACTION:** Moves to physically shield Elrik's body (interposing between him and Guardian Beta)

---

### GUARDIAN GAMMA'S TURN (Initiative 6)

> **Guardian Gamma (2d8 HD remaining, critically damaged) is in SURVIVAL MODE. It targets the nearest threat: Kessa (who just gutted it).**

**Attack: Stone Fist vs Kessa (desperate swing)**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[2]** → **0 successes**

**MISS!**

> **The guardian swings wildly—damaged leg gives out, attack goes wide. Kessa doesn't even have to dodge.**

**Guardian Gamma COLLAPSES to one knee, runes flickering.**

---

## END OF ROUND 3

**Party Status:**
- **Nyra:** 4d6 HD, 5/5 Resolve (wounded, 0 Affinity Dice left)
- **Kessa:** 7d10 HD, 5/5 Resolve (Magical Armor still intact, DOMINANT)
- **Elrik:** 3d8 HD, 3/5 Resolve (CRITICAL—wounded twice, SHAKEN)
- **Roots:** 4d8 HD, 3/5 Resolve (wounded, SHAKEN, healing spell FAILED)

**Enemy Status:**
- **Guardian Alpha:** 5d8 HD (damaged but functional)
- **Guardian Beta:** 6d8 HD (pursuing Elrik relentlessly)
- **Guardian Gamma:** 2d8 HD (CRITICAL, barely functional, collapsed)

**Critical Situation:**
- Elrik is being FOCUSED by Guardian Beta (wounded twice in a row)
- Roots is SHAKEN and unable to heal effectively
- Guardian Gamma is nearly destroyed (1 good hit will finish it)
- Kessa is untouchable but needs to draw aggression from Elrik
- Party Resolve is degrading (2 members SHAKEN)

---

## COMBAT - ROUND 4 (Turning Point)

### Initiative Order

1. Nyra (18)
2. Kessa (15)
3. Guardian Alpha (14)
4. Elrik (12)
5. Guardian Beta (10)
6. Roots (7)
7. Guardian Gamma (6)

---

### NYRA'S TURN (Initiative 18)

> **Nyra sees the pattern: Guardian Beta is killing Elrik. Kessa is invincible. Guardian Gamma is almost dead. She makes a tactical decision.**

**Nyra:** *"Kessa—FINISH Gamma! I'll cover Elrik!"*

**Action: Cast Curator's Bolt at Guardian Beta (the one killing Elrik)**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[4]** → **1 success**

**Damage:** 1d8 = **[3]** → **3 damage** (force, no resistance)

**Guardian Beta's Defense:**

Roll 2d10: **[6] + [8] = 14** → **2 successes**

**Nyra's attack: 1 success**  
**Guardian's defense: 2 successes**  

**Defense exceeds → NO DAMAGE**

> **The arcane bolt STRIKES but dissipates against heavy plating. Not enough.**

**Nyra (frustrated):** *"It's too armored!"*

---

### KESSA'S TURN (Initiative 15)

> **Kessa hears Nyra's call. Guardian Gamma is collapsed at her feet—helpless.**

**Kessa:** *"Mercy isn't on the menu today!"*

**Action: FINISHING BLOW on Guardian Gamma (coup de grâce)**

**Melee Attack (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[6]** → **1 success**

**Guardian Gamma's Defense (collapsed, disadvantage):**

Roll 2d10 twice: **[2] + [3] = 5** (0 successes) / **[4] + [7] = 11** (1 success)

**Take worse: 0 successes**

**Kessa's attack: 1 success**  
**Guardian's defense: 0 successes**  

**HIT! Auto-crit on helpless target?**

**Damage:** 1d8 = **[5]** → 5 damage, ÷2 = 2.5 → round down = 2 damage

**Guardian Gamma: 2d8 → 0d8**

**DESTROYED!**

> **Kessa raises her longsword high—brings it down in a brutal ARC. The blade CLEAVES through Guardian Gamma's neck joint. Bronze SNAPS. Stone head ROLLS across the floor. Runes go DARK.**
>
> **The first guardian FALLS. Clockwork twitches, then STOPS.**

**Kessa (breathing hard, grinning):** *"ONE DOWN! Who's next?!"*

**Enemies remaining: Alpha (5d8), Beta (6d8)**

---

### GUARDIAN ALPHA'S TURN (Initiative 14)

> **Alpha continues its Target Lock: KESSA.**

**Attack: Stone Fist vs Kessa**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[5]** → **1 success**

**Kessa's Magical Armor Defense:**

Roll 2d12: **[9] + [10] = 19** → **2 successes**

**Guardian's attack: 1 success**  
**Magical Armor: 2 successes**  

**Defense exceeds → NO DAMAGE, Magical Armor STILL holding (FIFTH absorbed attack!)**

> **Another swing. Another FLARE of arcane light. Another failure. Kessa stands unmoved.**

**Kessa:** *"Seriously, try ANYTHING ELSE!"*

---

### ELRIK'S TURN (Initiative 12)

> **Elrik (3d8 HD, SHAKEN, Resolve 3, bleeding out) knows he can't take another hit. He makes a desperate choice.**

**Elrik uses his TURN to:** 

**Action: DASH (double movement, fleeing combat)**

**Elrik RUNS 60 feet away from Guardian Beta, retreating to the chamber's edge near a Choir Pillar.**

**Elrik (shouting):** *"I can't—I can't fight it! I'm out!"*

**Guardian Beta does NOT get opportunity attack (Elrik used full Action to Dash safely)**

---

### GUARDIAN BETA'S TURN (Initiative 10)

> **Guardian Beta starts to pursue Elrik—but recalculates. New target priority: ROOTS (who is shielding Elrik's former position and damaged).**

**Attack: Blade-Arm vs Roots**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[6]** → **1 success**

**Roots' Defense:**

Roll 2d8 (hide): **[5] + [8] = 13** → **2 successes**

**Guardian's attack: 1 success**  
**Roots' defense: 2 successes**  

**Defense EXCEEDS → NO DAMAGE!**

> **Roots—despite being SHAKEN—manages to DEFLECT the blade with their staff. A desperate parry. It holds.**

**Roots (gasping):** *"Not... today..."*

---

### ROOTS' TURN (Initiative 7)

> **Roots (SHAKEN, 4d8 HD, Resolve 3) knows they need to END this fight. Healing isn't working. Time for OFFENSE.**

**Roots:** *"Ancestors—grant me FURY!"*

**Action: Spirit Strike (Advanced 3+, but SHAKEN makes it 4+)**

**NEW DIFFICULTY: 4 successes needed** (Shaken penalty adds +1)

**Activation Roll:** 1d6 (Prof 1) + **1d6 (Affinity Die - SPENT)** = **[5] + [6]** → **2 successes** (needs 4)

**Roots spends stored Affinity Die (Renewal-aligned: transformation through struggle)**

**Affinity Dice: 1/1 → 0/1**

**FAILURE!** (Only 2 successes, needed 4)

**Spirit Strike fails to activate AGAIN. Roots collapses to knees, exhausted.**

**Roots (broken):** *"I... I can't... Shaken too deeply..."*

---

### GUARDIAN GAMMA - DESTROYED (no turn)

---

## END OF ROUND 4

**Party Status:**
- **Nyra:** 4d6 HD, 5/5 Resolve, 0 Affinity Dice
- **Kessa:** 7d10 HD, 5/5 Resolve, 1 Affinity Die (MVP)
- **Elrik:** 3d8 HD, 3/5 Resolve (SHAKEN, fled combat, hiding by pillar)
- **Roots:** 4d8 HD, 3/5 Resolve (SHAKEN, 0 Affinity Dice, unable to function)

**Enemy Status:**
- **Guardian Alpha:** 5d8 HD (damaged, locked on Kessa)
- **Guardian Beta:** 6d8 HD (pursuing Roots/Elrik)
- **Guardian Gamma:** DESTROYED

**Critical Analysis:**
- Kessa's Magical Armor has absorbed **5 full attacks** (insanely valuable)
- SHAKEN status is CRIPPLING (Roots/Elrik can barely function with +1 success penalty)
- Elrik has retreated from combat (fight-or-flight chose flight)
- Party is grinding down guardians but SLOWLY
- Two party members are nearly combat-ineffective due to Resolve loss

---

## COMBAT - ROUND 5 (Final Push)

### KESSA'S DECISION

> **Kessa sees Roots and Elrik both BROKEN. Nyra is struggling. She's the ONLY one still strong. Time to end this.**

**Kessa (shouting):** *"EVERYONE BACK! Let the PROFESSIONAL handle this!"*

---

### Initiative Order

1. Nyra (18)
2. Kessa (15)
3. Guardian Alpha (14)
4. Elrik (12) - hiding
5. Guardian Beta (10)
6. Roots (7) - collapsed
7. Guardian Gamma - destroyed

---

**Guardian's defense: 1 success**  

**TIE → Attacker wins**

**HIT! 7 force damage (no resistance) → 7 damage = ~2 HD for d8**

**Guardian Alpha: 5d8 → 3d8** (critically damaged!)

> **Nyra's arcane bolt PUNCHES through a gap in the guardian's armor—strikes exposed bronze framework. Gears GRIND. The construct LURCHES.**

**Nyra:** *"Weak point exposed! Kessa—NOW!"*

---

### KESSA'S TURN (Initiative 15)

> **Kessa charges Guardian Alpha—damaged, exposed, perfect target.**

**Kessa:** *"THIS IS FOR MY FRIENDS!"*

**Action: Melee Attack (Longsword) + AFFINITY DIE**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 (Prof) + **1d6 (Affinity Die - SPENT)** = **[4] + [5]** → **2 successes**

**Kessa spends Affinity Die (Change-aligned: breaking stasis, destroying obstacles)**

**Affinity Dice: 1/1 → 0/1**

**Damage:** 1d8 = **[8]** → **8 damage**

**Guardian Alpha's Defense:**

Roll 2d10: **[5] + [2] = 7** → **1 success**

**Kessa's attack: 2 successes**  
**Guardian's defense: 1 success**  

**Attack EXCEEDS by 1 → FULL DAMAGE + bonus?**

**8 damage ÷ 2 (physical resistance) = 4 damage**

**Guardian Alpha: 3d8 → -1d8** → **DESTROYED!**

> **Kessa's blade SLAMS into the weak point Nyra exposed—drives DEEP into Guardian Alpha's core. She ROARS, twisting the blade. Bronze SHATTERS. Stone EXPLODES outward. Runes go DARK.**
>
> **The second guardian COLLAPSES, crashing onto the chamber floor with a sound like thunder.**

**Kessa (breathing hard, bloodied sword raised):** *"TWO DOWN!"*

**Remaining: Guardian Beta (6d8 HD)**

---

### GUARDIAN BETA'S TURN (Initiative 10)

> **The last guardian—alone, outnumbered—recalculates. Target: KESSA (highest threat).**

**Beta CHARGES Kessa across the chamber.**

**Attack: Blade-Arm vs Kessa (desperate)**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[6]** → **1 success**

**Kessa's Magical Armor Defense:**

Roll 2d12: **[7] + [12] = 19** → **2 successes**

**Guardian's attack: 1 success**  
**Magical Armor: 2 successes**  

**Defense exceeds → NO DAMAGE, Magical Armor STILL holding (SIXTH absorbed attack!)**

> **The blade-arm CRASHES against Kessa's arcane barrier—sparks fly, light FLARES. But the armor HOLDS. Kessa grins through the impact.**

**Kessa:** *"You're going to DIE tired!"*

---

### ROUND 5 CONTINUES

**Elrik (hiding, SHAKEN, 3d8 HD):** *Stays hidden, too wounded and demoralized to act*

**Roots (collapsed, SHAKEN, 4d8 HD):** *Attempting to regain composure, breathing exercises, no action*

---

### NYRA'S TURN (Initiative 18, Round 5 cont.)

**Nyra:** *"Kessa—one more! Finish it!"*

**Action: Curator's Bolt at Guardian Beta**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[3]** → **1 success**

**Damage:** 1d8 = **[4]** → **4 damage** (force)

**Guardian Beta's Defense:**

Roll 2d10: **[8] + [4] = 12** → **1 success**

**TIE → Attacker wins**

**HIT! 4 force damage → ~1 HD for d8**

**Guardian Beta: 6d8 → 5d8**

> **Another arcane bolt—strikes Guardian Beta's back. Minor damage, but it STAGGERS the construct.**

---

### KESSA'S TURN (Initiative 15, Round 5 cont.)

> **Kessa circles the last guardian like a predator.**

**Kessa:** *"Just you and me now, bucket."*

**Action: Melee Attack (Longsword) - EXECUTING**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+):** 1d6 = **[5]** → **1 success**

**Damage:** 1d8 = **[6]** → **6 damage**

**Guardian Beta's Defense:**

Roll 2d10: **[3] + [7] = 10** → **1 success**

**TIE → Attacker wins**

**HIT! 6 damage ÷ 2 = 3 damage**

**Guardian Beta: 5d8 → 2d8** (CRITICAL)

> **Kessa's blade HACKS into Guardian Beta's leg—the SAME leg Elrik's arrow damaged earlier. Bronze framework SNAPS. The guardian's leg COLLAPSES. It falls to one knee.**

**Kessa:** *"KNEEL before Change!"*

---

### GUARDIAN BETA'S TURN (collapsed, desperate)

**Attack: Blade-Arm (from kneeling position, disadvantage)**

**Attack Roll (Basic 2+, disadvantage):**

Roll 1: 1d6 = **[2]** → 0 successes  
Roll 2: 1d6 = **[4]** → 1 success  

**Take worse: 0 successes**

**MISS!**

> **The guardian swings wildly from its knees—blade-arm passes harmlessly over Kessa's head. Desperation, not precision.**

---

### FINAL BLOW - KESSA (Initiative 15, Round 6 opening)

> **Kessa steps close to the kneeling guardian. She places her sword's point against its chest—right where the core rune glows.**

**Kessa:** *"Your protocol is ENDED."*

**She THRUSTS.**

**Melee Attack (Basic 2+, against helpless target):**

**Auto-hit. Damage:** 1d8 = **[7]** → 7 damage ÷ 2 = 3.5 → round down = 3

**Guardian Beta: 2d8 → -1d8** → **DESTROYED**

> **The blade PLUNGES through the core rune. The glow SHATTERS. Clockwork STOPS. The guardian goes LIMP—a puppet with cut strings.**
>
> **Kessa withdraws her blade. Guardian Beta collapses forward, lifeless.**
>
> **Silence.**
>
> **The Choir Pillars' discordant song... fades to quiet hum.**
>
> **The battle is WON.**

---

## AFTERMATH - Combat Ends

### Party Status (End of Combat)

**Survivors:**
- **Nyra:** 4d6 HD (67% health), 5/5 Resolve
- **Kessa:** 7d10 HD (100% health), 5/5 Resolve - **UNHARMED, MVP**
- **Elrik:** 3d8 HD (50% health), 3/5 Resolve (SHAKEN)
- **Roots:** 4d8 HD (67% health), 3/5 Resolve (SHAKEN)

**Enemies:**
- All 3 Temple Guardians: DESTROYED

**Resources Expended:**
- **Affinity Dice:** All 4 spent (Nyra, Roots, Kessa all used theirs)
- **War Cry:** Used (failed)
- **Grit:** Not needed
- **Exertion Dice:** 1 used (Elrik, didn't burn)
- **Magical Armor:** INTACT after absorbing 6+ attacks (incredible value)

---

### The Fallen Engineers

> **As the last echoes of combat fade, you approach the bodies near the northern tunnel.**
>
> **Three engineers. All dead. Crushed by stone fists or slashed by blade-arms. They never stood a chance—unarmed surveyors against combat constructs.**

**Roots (kneeling, still SHAKEN but functional):** *"Their spirits linger still. Shall I... guide them to rest?"*

**Nyra:** *"Yes. They deserve peace."*

**Roots performs brief funeral rites, using Voice of the Accord to guide the spirits onward.**

> **Three ethereal forms rise from the corpses—confused, afraid. Roots speaks in ancient tongues. The spirits LISTEN. Understanding dawns. They bow in gratitude, then FADE into silver mist, journeying to whatever comes after.**

**AFFINITY DIE EARNED - ROOTS:**

**Roots helped spirits complete transition (death → afterlife), facilitating renewal of cycle.**

**Roots earns 1 Affinity Die** → **Currently Stored: 1/1**

---

### Looting the Fallen (Guardians)

**Investigation Check (Basic 2+)** - searching destroyed guardians for salvage:

**Elrik (SHAKEN, +1 success penalty, needs 3+ now):** 1d6 = **[6]** → 1 success (fails modified Basic 3+)

**Elrik's hands shake too much to salvage properly.**

**Nyra (stable):** 1d6 = **[5]** → 1 success ✓

**Nyra succeeds!**

**Salvage Found:**
- **3× Guardian Core Runes** (faintly magical, could be sold or studied—50g each)
- **Bronze Framework Shards** (raw material, 20g worth)
- **Intact Clockwork Mechanism** (could be repurposed, 100g value or used for crafting)

**Total Salvage Value:** ~270 gold worth of materials

---

### Post-Combat Condition Assessment

**Resolve Recovery:**

**Elrik (SHAKEN, Resolve 3):** Still suffering penalties (+1 success to all actions). Needs **Short Rest** to regain 1 Resolve.

**Roots (SHAKEN, Resolve 3):** Same—needs Short Rest.

**Both are traumatized from near-death experiences and need time to recover.**

---

## Scene 2: The Chamber's Secret

### Investigation (While Resting)

**The party takes a SHORT REST in the chamber (1 hour).**

**SHORT REST RESTORATION:**
- **HD:** No restoration (Short Rest doesn't restore HD in this system)
- **Resolve:** Each character regains **+1 Resolve**

**Post-Rest Status:**
- Nyra: 4d6 HD, 5/5 Resolve (already max)
- Kessa: 7d10 HD, 5/5 Resolve (already max)
- Elrik: 3d8 HD, **4/5 Resolve** (was SHAKEN, now PRESSURED)
- Roots: 4d8 HD, **4/5 Resolve** (was SHAKEN, now PRESSURED)

**Elrik and Roots are NO LONGER SHAKEN** (penalties removed!)

---

### Elrik's Discovery

> **During the rest, Elrik (Scholar's Method, obsessive note-taker) examines the Choir Pillars more closely.**

**Investigation/Lore Check (Moderate 3+) + Scholar's Method (+2d6):**

**Roll:** 1d6 (Prof) + 2d6 (Path bonus) = **[4] + [6] + [5]** → **3 successes** ✓

**EXCELLENT SUCCESS!**

**What Elrik discovers:**

> **The eleven remaining Choir Pillars aren't just structural—they're ARCHIVES. Each pillar contains historical records carved in microscopic runes along its surface. Pre-Schism knowledge. Astronomical charts. Ley-line maps. Theological treatises.**
>
> **And one pillar—Pillar #7—shows the ORIGINAL PURPOSE of this temple:**
>
> ***"Temple of the Foundation's Cradle - Built in the 3rd century of the Divine Accord. Purpose: To birth Stone-Children (constructs imbued with purpose) and send them on pilgrimage to Khuldras' Spine. Those who complete the journey become Foundation-Keepers (divine servitors). This chamber served as the BIRTHING GROUND for hundreds of Pilgrims over centuries."***
>
> **The guardians weren't intruders—they were FAILED PILGRIMS. Constructs who couldn't complete the journey, reassigned as temple defenders.**

**Elrik (awed):** *"We're standing in a nursery. A place where gods were born."*

**Nyra:** *"And the miners almost turned it into a quarry."*

## Scene 3: Return to Stonebridge

### Carrying the Dead

**The party wraps the three engineers' bodies in cloaks, carries them back up the 400-foot shaft.**

**ATHLETICS CHECK (Basic 2+, carrying weight):**

**Group check:**
- Nyra: 1d6 = **[3]** → 1 success
- Roots: 1d6 = **[6]** → 1 success
- Kessa: 1d6 = **[5]** → 1 success
- Elrik: 1d6 = **[4]** → 1 success

**Total: 4 successes** (well exceeds Basic 2+)

**The climb is slow, somber, but successful.**

---

### The Council's Response

> **Harlan Vex (merchant councilor) weeps when he sees the bodies—one was his nephew.**
>
> **Priestess Kara performs Last Rites immediately.**
>
> **Captain Torvald pays you without question: 900 gold (225g each).**
>
> **Durg Blackiron (mine foreman, guilt-ridden):** *"I should have left it alone. All of this... my greed killed them."*

**Nyra (quietly):** *"Your greed cracked the seal. But the guardians killed them. And we ended the guardians. The cycle is complete."*

**Harlan:** *"What about the chamber? Is it safe to study? To... use?"*

**Elrik:** *"It's a sacred site. A place where divine constructs were BORN. If you desecrate it for profit, I guarantee worse things than guardians will come."*

**Long silence.**

**Priestess Kara:** *"The vote is simple. Do we sanctify the chamber as holy ground—or mine it for gold?"*

**COUNCIL VOTE:**
- Kara (sanctify): Aye
- Torvald (no more deaths): Aye
- Mira (commonfolk rep, fearful): Aye
- Durg (guilt-ridden): ...Aye
- Harlan (furious but defeated): Abstain

**4-0-1 → The chamber is SANCTIFIED.**

**Harlan storms out. The others remain.**

## Epilogue: Three Weeks Later

### The Pilgrim's Progress

**Messenger riders return with reports:**

> **The Stone Pilgrim has been sighted moving north through the Ashfeld Plains—exactly as promised, walking carefully around settlements, pausing when travelers approach, moving at night when roads are empty.**
>
> **One report from a village mayor:** *"It stopped outside our town, knelt before our shrine to Khuldras, and waited until dawn. When the priest came out, it asked: 'How many days to the Spine?' The priest told it: '60 days at your pace.' It bowed and continued north. Our children call it The Patient Mountain."*

**The Pilgrim is keeping its oath.**

---

### The Chamber's Fate

**Priestess Kara converts the Chamber of Choir Pillars into a SHRINE.**

**Pilgrims (of Khuldras, scholars, construct-makers) begin visiting to study the Pillars' archives.**

**Stonebridge becomes a theological destination—ironically more profitable than mining.**

**Harlan Vex grudgingly profits from the inn/supply trade.**

---

## END OF SESSION 3

**To Be Continued...**

## Playtest Metrics & Analysis

### Combat Statistics

**Rounds of Combat:** 6 rounds (Initiative-based)  
**Enemies Defeated:** 3 Temple Guardians (8 HD each)  
**Damage Dealt by Party:** ~15 HD worth of damage total  
**Damage Taken by Party:** Nyra 2 HD, Roots 4 HD (total), Elrik 6 HD  
**Total HD Lost:** 12 HD out of 25 (48% casualty rate)  
**Final State:** 4 HD (Nyra), 7 HD (Kessa), 3 HD (Elrik), 4 HD (Roots) = **18/25 HD remaining**

---

### Resolve System Testing

**RESOLVE CHECKS TRIGGERED: 4 total**

1. **Roots (Round 1):** Lost 2 HD → Rolled [3] → Lost 1 Resolve (5→4, Pressured)
2. **Nyra (Round 1):** Lost 2 HD → Rolled [5] → Held Resolve (stayed 5)
3. **Elrik (Round 2):** Lost 3 HD → Rolled [2] → Lost 1 Resolve (5→4, Pressured)
4. **Roots (Round 2):** Lost 2 HD → Rolled [1] → Lost 1 Resolve (4→3, SHAKEN)

**Resolve Stages Observed:**
- **Resolve 5 (Full Strength):** No penalties
- **Resolve 4 (Pressured):** No Expert+ actions (not tested, party is Level 2)
- **Resolve 3 (SHAKEN):** +1 success needed for ALL actions → **CRIPPLING**

**SHAKEN Impact:**
- Roots failed healing spell (needed 3+ instead of 2+, rolled only 1 success)
- Roots failed Spirit Strike twice (needed 4+ instead of 3+, only got 2 successes even with Affinity Die)
- Elrik fled combat (player choice influenced by Shaken status)

**Critical Discovery:** SHAKEN status (+1 success penalty) makes characters nearly COMBAT-INEFFECTIVE at Level 2 (only 1d6 Prof). This creates **death spiral** risk.

---

### HD Damage Layer Testing

**Magical Armor Performance:**
- Cast on Kessa (tank)
- **Absorbed 6+ full attacks** without breaking
- Guardian attacks averaged 1 success, Magical Armor consistently defended with 2+ successes (2d12 very strong)
- **INCREDIBLE VALUE** for a free ritual

**Armor Effectiveness:**
- Light (2d6): Defended some attacks, but frequently tied (attacker wins ties)
- Medium (2d8): More reliable, defended better than light
- Magical (2d12): Almost never failed defense

**Physical Resistance:**
- Halving physical damage was SIGNIFICANT (6 damage → 3 damage, 8 → 4)
- Made guardians VERY durable against Kessa/Elrik (melee/bow)
- Force damage (Nyra's cantrips) bypassed resistance (critical!)

---

### Class Performance Analysis

**WEAVER (Nyra) - Support MVP:**
- Magical Armor saved Kessa's life (absorbed 6+ attacks)
- Curator's Bolt dealt consistent damage (force ignores resistance)
- Unravel disrupted Guardian Gamma (disadvantage on defense = fight-ender)
- Healing cantrip saved Roots
- **Verdict:** Support/control mage excels when paired with durable tank

**SHAMAN (Roots) - Struggled Under Pressure:**
- Spiritual abilities (guidance, spirit communion) worked great in non-combat
- Spirit Strike failed twice (Advanced tier too hard at Level 2 + Shaken penalty)
- Healing kept Elrik alive initially
- **BUT:** Resolve loss made them combat-ineffective by Round 3
- **Verdict:** SHAKEN death spiral is too punishing for support characters

**COMBATANT (Kessa) - DOMINANT:**
- Magical Armor + high natural armor + shield = **UNTOUCHABLE**
- Dealt solid damage despite physical resistance
- War Cry failed (Advanced check too hard), but didn't need it
- Finished 2 guardians with brutal efficiency
- **Verdict:** With proper support (Magical Armor), tank is UNSTOPPABLE

**RANGER (Elrik) - Glass Cannon Shattered:**
- Bow attacks struggled against heavy armor (2d10 defense)
- Physical resistance halved his damage
- Got TARGETED by Guardian Beta (nearly died twice)
- Fled combat due to SHAKEN status + trauma
- **Verdict:** Fragile DPS without magical support gets DESTROYED

---

### Critical Mechanics Issues Identified

**ISSUE 1: SHAKEN DEATH SPIRAL**

**Problem:** Resolve 3 (SHAKEN) adds +1 success to ALL actions. At Level 2 (1d6 Prof), this means:
- Basic 2+ becomes 3+ (83% → 50% success rate)
- Advanced 3+ becomes 4+ (50% → 33% success rate)

**Impact:** Roots and Elrik became nearly USELESS after hitting Shaken.

**Potential Solutions:**
- Reduce Shaken penalty to +1 success only on Advanced+ actions (leave Basic alone)?
- Allow Rally action (spend Affinity Die to regain 1 Resolve as bonus action)?
- Make Resolve checks easier to pass (5-6 = hold/gain instead of just 6 = gain)?

---

**ISSUE 2: LEVEL 2 ADVANCED ACTIONS REMAIN VERY HARD**

**Advanced tier = 3+ successes**  
**Level 2 Proficiency = 1d6**  
**Success rate on 1d6 for 3+:** ~17% (need two 5+ rolls on impossible single die)

**Wait, that's not right. Let me recalculate:**

1d6 can produce **maximum 1 success** (each 5+ = 1 success)

**To get 2 successes (Advanced tier), you NEED 2 dice minimum.**

**Observed in playtest:**
- War Cry failed (1d6 only, needed 2 successes)
- Spirit Strike failed twice (1d6 only, needed 2 successes, even with Affinity Die got only 2 total = still failed when Shaken made it 4+)
- Only successful Advanced actions: Those with Path bonuses (Scholar's Method +2d6)

**Is this intended?** At Level 2, characters should succeed at Advanced actions ~30-50% of time IF using Exertion/Affinity Dice.

**Current reality:** Base (1d6) = 0% chance of Advanced success (mathematically impossible to get 2 successes from 1 die)

---

**ISSUE 3: INITIATIVE SYSTEM (d20 vs d6)**

**I used d6 for initiative (error).** User clarified: Initiative should be **d20 + bonus d6s** from abilities.

**Impact:** d6 initiative created very little variation (range 1-6). d20 would spread initiative more (range 1-20+).

**This needs correction in future sessions.**

---

### Resources Management

**Affinity Dice:**
- All 4 party members spent theirs (Nyra on Unravel, Roots on failed Spirit Strike, Kessa on finishing Alpha, Elrik didn't spend his)
- Roots earned 1 back (guiding spirits)
- System feels balanced (earn via roleplay, spend for clutch moments)

**Exertion Dice:**
- Only Elrik used one (didn't burn on [2])
- Under-utilized (party was conservative with resources)

**Magical Armor:**
- **INCREDIBLY POWERFUL** (absorbed 6+ attacks, free ritual, lasts until destroyed)
- Might be TOO good? Or is this the intended power level for prep?

**War Cry:**
- Used once, failed (Advanced check on 1d6 = impossible)
- Resource wasted

**Grit:**
- Never needed (Kessa never dropped to 0 HD thanks to Magical Armor)

---

### Lethality Assessment

**Damage Taken:**
- Nyra: 2 HD from 1 hit (33% of max)
- Roots: 4 HD from 2 hits (67% of max)
- Elrik: 6 HD from 2 hits (100% of max—would be dead without healing)

**Average damage per hit:** ~2-3 HD per successful attack

**At Level 2 (6-7 HD average), characters can take ~2-3 hits before death.**

**Healing availability:** Nyra and Roots can both cast healing cantrips (1d4-1d6 HD restored)

**Conclusion:** Combat is LETHAL but SURVIVABLE with active healing. Without healing, party would have lost Elrik and Roots.

---

### What Session 3 Successfully Tested

✅ **Resolve system** (4 checks, multiple stages, Shaken penalties observed)  
✅ **HD damage layers** (armor, magical armor, resistance, tracking)  
✅ **Shaman combat abilities** (Spirit Strike attempts, healing)  
✅ **Combatant combat features** (War Cry attempt, tank role, Magical Armor synergy)  
✅ **Death & Dying proximity** (Elrik nearly died twice)  
✅ **Concentration under fire** (Magical Armor stayed active despite damage)  
✅ **Physical resistance** (halved damage significantly)  
✅ **Force damage bypass** (Nyra's cantrips critical)  
✅ **Short Rest Resolve recovery** (+1 Resolve, removed Shaken status)  
✅ **Affinity Die spending reactively** (after seeing roll results)  
✅ **Group vs individual checks** (group Athletics, individual combat rolls)  

---

### What Still Needs Testing

❌ **Death & Dying at 0 HD** (Elrik got close but was healed both times)  
❌ **Maximum Exertion trigger** (using Level = exertion dice in one round)  
❌ **Concentration disruption from failed Resolve** (no concentration spells were disrupted)  
❌ **Legendary/Ultimate tier actions** (not available at Level 2)  
❌ **Trapped Below full attrition** (party can return to town, get long rest)  
❌ **Multiple combats without rest** (test cumulative resource drain)  
❌ **Level 3 progression** (happens after Session 5 per user's plan)  

---

### Recommendations for Future Sessions

**BALANCE ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED:**

1. **Resolve System:**
   - Shaken penalty feels too harsh at low levels
   - Consider: Shaken only affects Advanced+ (leave Basic at 2+)
   - OR: Allow Rally action (bonus action: spend Affinity Die → regain 1 Resolve)

2. **Advanced Actions at Level 2:**
   - Currently mathematically impossible without Exertion/Affinity Dice
   - Is this intended? Should Advanced tier be achievable via base Prof sometimes?
   - OR: Reduce Advanced to **2+ successes** (instead of 3+)?

3. **Magical Armor Power Level:**
   - 2d12 outer layer is VERY strong
   - Absorbed 6+ attacks (more valuable than all other abilities combined)
   - Is this intended? Or should duration be shorter / defense lower?

4. **Guardian Armor:**
   - 2d10 defense made them VERY durable
   - Combined with physical resistance = bullet sponges
   - Players needed magic damage to bypass (only Nyra had it consistently)
   - Intentional dungeon design or too hard for Level 2?
