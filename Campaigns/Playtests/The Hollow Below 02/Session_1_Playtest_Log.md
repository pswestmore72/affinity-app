## Hook: Divergent Arrivals (Testing Playtest 02 Variant)

*Unlike Playtest 01's straightforward recruitment, this party arrives via different motivations, testing how Level 1 characters with distinct philosophical Affinities navigate the same crisis.*

**Nyra Thornweave** arrived three days ago, drawn by rumors of miners dying in the dark. *"They shouldn't die alone,"* she told the innkeeper. She's been quietly observing, offering comfort to grieving families, learning the names of the dead. Shadow Affinity compels her—these deaths were sudden, violent, far from home. Someone must witness.

**Roots-Between-Stone** came when the tremors began disrupting the Verdant Verge's cycles hundreds of miles away. Ancient stone carries vibrations far—and the Accord whispered that something sealed was prevented from transforming. The firbolg arrived yesterday, speaking little, listening to the earth with one massive hand pressed to cobblestones. Renewal demands completion of interrupted cycles.

**Kessa Ironvow** was passing through when militia tried to bar the western road "for your safety." She laughed in their faces. No one tells her where she can't go. Now she's camped at the edge of town, watching the mine entrance with hungry eyes. Something trapped for 800 years? She wants to meet it. Change recognizes a kindred spirit—locked things either break free or die trying.

**Elrik Canmore** is here because ancient sealed architecture doesn't unseal itself. He's spent two days interviewing miners, sketching the tremor patterns, reading every scrap of historical record the town archives possess. His journals document everything. Knowledge demands understanding before action—but time is running out.

## Scene 1: The Fourth Tremor (Opening - Different Approach)

### Narrative

> **Mid-morning. The four of you stand in different parts of Stonebridge's main square—not yet a party, just four strangers drawn to the same crisis for different reasons.**
>
> **Nyra is leaving the small shrine where she helped a widow perform Last Rites for her husband (died in the mine collapse). Silver tokens hang from her belt—memorial gifts from the grieving.**
>
> **Roots sits cross-legged in the square's center, palm pressed to stone, eyes closed. Townsfolk give the massive firbolg a wide berth. Moss-covered antlers adorned with living vines make them look like a piece of the Verge itself transplanted here.**
>
> **Kessa leans against the south wall, arms crossed, watching the Town Hall steps where five Council members are setting up for another public meeting. Her hand rests casually on her sword hilt. Everything about her posture says: *Try to stop me from going where I want.***
>
> **Elrik stands near a merchant's cart, interviewing the driver about whether the tremors follow a pattern. His third journal is already half-full of notes. He doesn't notice the three strangers yet—too focused on data.**
>
> **Then the ground shudders.**
>
> **This tremor is different. Deeper. Longer. A low rumble like stone grinding against stone echoes from the western hills where The Delve rises. Market crates topple. A child stumbles and cries out. An elderly merchant grabs a post to keep from falling.**
>
> **The tremor lasts fifteen seconds—an eternity compared to the previous three.**
>
> **When it subsides, Roots opens their eyes and speaks in a voice like wind through leaves:** ***"It's waking."***

### Mechanical Observations

**Automatic Character Reactions** (Level 1 abilities triggering instinctively):

**Nyra (Weave Sight - Passive):**
- Automatically detects magical auras and Weave disturbances within 10 yards
- **What she sees:** Faint silver threads of disruption rippling through the Weave, emanating from the west like aftershocks through reality itself
- **Roll: Read the Weave (Basic 2+)** to extend range and determine source
  - Rolls 1d6 (Prof 1): **[5]** → **1 success**
  - Range extends to 20 yards (10 base + 10 per success)
  - **Discovers:** The Weave distortions aren't magical spell effects—they're *architectural*. Something massive beneath the earth is shifting, and its movement warps reality like a stone dropped in water creating ripples.
- Nyra's eyes narrow. *"This isn't a spell. It's a structure. Something enormous is moving underground."*

**Roots (Spiritual Guidance - Passive):**
- Automatically detects spirits, ghosts, and spiritual disturbances within 30 yards
- **What they sense:** The tremor carries *screaming*—not physical voices, but spiritual resonance. Something was sealed with spirits still bound to it. They're agitated, confused, crying out after centuries of silence.
- Roots' antlers tremble. Living vines writhe. *"Spirits. Trapped. They've been waiting 800 years to be heard. This... disrupts the cycle."*

**Kessa (Battle Sense - Passive):**
- Gains +2d6 to all rolls involving battlefield tactics, reading combat situations
- **What she reads:** The militia guards on the western road are positioning defensively (shields out, watching the hills). The Town Council members are arguing with panicked body language. Civilians are clustering near packed wagons—ready to flee if things get worse.
- **Tactical assessment:** This situation is escalating toward either mass exodus or violent desperation. The town is a powder keg.
- Kessa grins. *"Finally. Something's about to happen."*

**Elrik (Nature's Treaty - Passive):**
- Auto-succeeds all Basic tier Wilderness checks
- **Automatic knowledge:** This tremor pattern is NOT geological. Natural earthquakes don't follow regular intervals (previous three were ~4 hours apart, now this one after 3 hours). Something is causing them deliberately—or something large is moving with increasing frequency.
- Elrik's hand flies across his journal, sketching tremor intensity graphs. *"The intervals are decreasing. Whatever's causing this is accelerating."*

---

### The Moment of Connection

> **Four strangers, four observations, one shared conclusion.**
>
> **Your eyes meet across the square.**
>
> **Nyra (holding silver memorial tokens): "Something enormous is moving beneath the earth."**
>
> **Roots (hand still pressed to stone): "Spirits trapped for centuries are crying out."**
>
> **Kessa (grinning at the chaos): "And the town's about to tear itself apart."**
>
> **Elrik (looking up from his notes): "The tremors are accelerating. We're running out of time."**
>
> **On the Town Hall steps, the Council begins shouting again. The crowd presses closer, anxious and angry.**

### Decision Point #1: How to Approach the Crisis

**Unlike Playtest 01** (where Torvan stepped forward with command authority to volunteer the party), **this group has no established leader and very different approaches**:

**OPTIONS:**

**A) Listen to Council Argument First (Gather information before acting)**
- Elrik's instinct: *"We need data. What do they know that we don't?"*
- Moderate Awareness/Investigation checks to pick up key details
- Low profile, analytical approach

**B) Approach Council Publicly (Offer to help immediately)**
- Kessa's instinct: *"Stop arguing and let me handle it."*
- Requires Influence check (Advanced 3+) - but Level 1 characters only have 1d6 (Prof 1)
- High risk, high visibility

**C) Investigate Town/Miners Privately (Skip Council entirely)**
- Nyra's instinct: *"The grieving know more than politicians. Let me talk to the families."*
- Bypass official channels, get ground truth from victims
- Stealth/social skills, slower information gathering

**D) Spiritual Reconnaissance (Roots' unique option)**
- Roots' instinct: *"I should speak with the spirits. They witnessed what happened."*
- Requires moving closer to The Delve, possibly using **Spirit Sight** or **Speak with Beast**
- Direct supernatural information, but risks attracting attention

**GROUP DECISION** (testing party dynamics at Level 1):

Elrik speaks first, practical: *"We need to know what they know. Let's listen."*

Nyra nods. *"Agreed. But afterward, I want to talk to the families. The dead always tell the truth—and those who mourn them remember."*

Kessa shrugs. *"Fine. Listen first. But if they spend another hour arguing while the ground shakes, I'm going down there myself."*

Roots says nothing—just watches the western hills where The Delve rises, their expression troubled.

**PARTY CHOOSES OPTION A: Listen & Observe**

---

## Scene 2: The Divided Council (Information Gathering)

### Narrative

> **The five Council members take their positions on the Town Hall steps. You position yourselves in the crowd—close enough to hear clearly, far enough to avoid immediate attention.**
>
> **The argument begins exactly as it has for the past three days:**
>
> **Kara Ironshod (dwarf priestess, bronze-trimmed robes):** *"Four tremors in one morning! The gods are SCREAMING at us! We broke ancient seals, desecrated a temple, and now the earth itself rejects our presence! Collapse the shaft, seal the breach, and BEG forgiveness!"*
>
> **Captain Torvald Greystone (human militia captain):** *"I have four dead miners and eight who won't speak of what they saw. We're not sending more people into that deathtrap. Seal it, post permanent guards, declare the western hills off-limits."*
>
> **Mira Ashford (young human commonfolk representative):** *"My people are TERRIFIED! Children wake screaming! Families are packing to leave! We need ACTION—I don't care if it's sealing or clearing, but we need SAFETY!"*
>
> **Durg Blackiron (dwarf mine foreman, defensive):** *"That chamber could hold CENTURIES of lost knowledge! Ancient artifacts, rare minerals, historical records! We can't just... we invested YEARS into reaching that depth! We were so close!"* *(Guilt flickers across his face)*
>
> **Harlan Vex (human merchant, calculating):** *"If we seal the mine permanently, Stonebridge dies. Our economy is 70% mining. We'll be a ghost town in two years. We MUST go back down—carefully, professionally—and secure whatever's there."*
>
> **The crowd erupts. Arguments spread like fire.**

### Investigation Checks (Party Observes)

**Each character rolls to notice different details based on their focus:**

---

**ELRIK (Knowledge focus - analyzing the situation):**

**Investigation Check (Moderate 3+)** - trying to extract technical details from the argument:

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[4]** → **1 success** (needs 2 for Moderate)

**Partial success** - catches some details:
- The "chamber" they breached is described as "enormous" (Durg's words)
- Depth: ~400 feet below surface (Shaft #7 is the deepest)
- The breakthrough happened **5 days ago**
- First death occurred **4 days ago** (one day after breach)
- Tremors started **3 days ago** (escalating since)

**Elrik activates Path ability: Recall Lore (Scholar's Method, 1/long rest):**
- *"I remember reading something about deep temple construction in pre-Schism texts..."*
- **GM provides useful information:** Temples built to earth deities (like Khuldras, the Deep Foundation) often used **ley-node architecture**—they stabilized reality by channeling cosmic force through stone. Breaking their seals destabilizes the ley-node, which can cause spatial distortions, reality fractures, and eventually **catastrophic structural collapse** if not re-sealed or properly dispersed.

Elrik's eyes widen. He scribbles frantically: *"It's not just unstable—it's DEGRADING. The ley-node is fracturing."*

---

**NYRA (Shadow-Trained focus - reading people's hidden truths):**

**Awareness Check (Moderate 3+)** - watching body language, looking for what's NOT being said:

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[3]** → **1 success** (needs 2 for Moderate)

**Partial success** - notices surface details:
- Durg keeps glancing at the families of dead miners with visible guilt
- Captain Torvald's hand shakes slightly when he mentions "what they saw"
- Kara's anger seems genuine but she's afraid (her voice cracks once)

**Nyra uses Shadow-Trained stealth bonus** - slips through crowd to get closer to the Council, trying to overhear private exchanges:

**Stealth Check (Basic 2+)** in dim shadow between market stalls:
- +1d6 from Shadow-Trained in dim light/darkness
- Rolls: 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Path bonus) = **[5] + [4]** → **2 successes**

**Success!** Nyra moves unnoticed to the Council's blind spot, close enough to hear Durg whisper to Harlan:
- Durg (quiet, ashamed): *"I should have listened when the first pickaxe strike rang wrong. The stone... it rang like a bell, Harlan. Like we were hitting something hollow. Something that wanted to stay closed."*
- Harlan (cold calculation): *"What's done is done. Now we profit or we collapse. There's no middle ground."*

Nyra's expression darkens. *"Greed opened this. Fear keeps it open. Neither will solve it."*

---

**KESSA (Battle Sense - reading tactical situation):**

**Awareness Check (Moderate 3+) + Battle Sense (+2d6 for tactical analysis):**

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof) + 2d6 (Battle Sense) = **[2] + [5] + [3]** → **2 successes (5s and 3s count)**

**SUCCESS!** Kessa reads the situation like a battlefield:

**Key observations:**
1. **Faction Lines Are Clear:**
   - **Seal Faction:** Kara (religious/safety) + Torvald (security) = 2 votes
   - **Profit Faction:** Harlan (economics) + Durg (ambition) = 2 votes
   - **Swing Vote:** Mira (representing terrified civilians)

2. **Tactical Weaknesses:**
   - Militia guards (12 visible) are spread thin across town perimeter
   - Western road to The Delve has only 3 guards—easily bypassed
   - No one's actually PREVENTING entry to the mine (just discouraging it)

3. **Critical Insight:**
   - **Mira will vote to seal** if the tremors continue escalating (fear wins)
   - **Mira will vote to clear** if someone credible offers to fix it (hope wins)
   - The Council is one convincing argument away from action—but which action?

Kessa smirks. *"This fight's already decided. They just don't know it yet. Whoever acts first wins."*

---

**ROOTS (Spiritual focus - reading unseen forces):**

**Awareness Check (Moderate 3+)** - but Roots isn't watching the Council—they're watching the SPIRITS:

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[6]** → **1 success** (needs 2 for Moderate)

**Partial success—but Spiritual Guidance (Passive) activates:**
- Automatically detects spirits within 30 yards
- **What Roots senses:** The town square sits on old ground. There are faint spirit echoes here—generations of market-goers, builders, travelers. But beneath those familiar presences, there's something ELSE.
- **A presence watching from the west.** Not malicious—but vast. Old. Waiting.

Roots stands abruptly, antlers casting strange shadows. The vines woven through their fur writhe.

**Roots speaks, quiet but certain:** *"Something hears us. It's been listening since the seal broke."*

The three other party members turn to look at the towering firbolg.

Nyra (understanding immediately): *"The spirits you mentioned?"*

Roots: *"No. Something older. The spirits are afraid of it."*

---

### Information Synthesized (Party Shares Observations)

The four of you drift to the edge of the crowd as the Council argument continues. You share what you've learned:

**Elrik:** *"The chamber they breached was part of a ley-node temple. Breaking the seal is causing reality fractures. If we don't stabilize it—or disperse the energy properly—the entire structure could collapse catastrophically."*

**Nyra:** *"The foreman knew the seal was intentional. He broke it anyway. Greed and ambition always think they're entitled to what was buried. Now people are dead."*

**Kessa:** *"The Council's deadlocked. They'll argue for days while the ground shakes. We could bypass them entirely—those guards on the western road wouldn't stop me."*

**Roots:** *"Something vast is awake beneath the earth. It's been sealed for 800 years. Now it's aware of us—and I don't know if it's angry, curious, or merely... stirring."*

**Silence for a moment.**

**Elrik:** *"We need to go down there. Whether to study it, stabilize it, or seal it properly—we need to SEE what we're dealing with."*

**Nyra:** *"Agreed. But we should understand what killed those miners first. I want to talk to the survivors—or the families of the dead. They witnessed something."*

**Kessa:** *"Or we just go now. The Council's not going to hire us—they can't even agree on lunch."*

**Roots:** *"The spirits can guide us. But we should prepare. Whatever is down there... it will not ignore us like it ignored the miners."*

---

### Decision Point #2: Approach Strategy

**OPTION A: Volunteer to the Council (Official sanction, resources, payment)**
- Requires Influence check (Advanced 3+) - DIFFICULT at Level 1 (only 1d6 Prof)
- Grants: Payment (200g upfront, 500g on completion), supplies, official backing
- Downside: Delays immediate action, requires negotiation

**OPTION B: Interview Survivors/Families (Gather ground truth before descending)**
- Requires social checks (Moderate difficulty), time investment (~1 hour)
- Grants: Critical information about what killed the miners, survivor testimony
- Downside: Delays descent, but increases prep

**OPTION C: Investigate The Delve Entrance (Reconnaissance without full descent)**
- Requires Stealth checks to bypass guards, Wilderness/Investigation at mine
- Grants: Firsthand assessment of danger, partial intel
- Downside: Risky without full information

**OPTION D: Descend Immediately (Bypass Council entirely, take initiative)**
- No checks required to start—just go
- Grants: Immediate action, element of surprise
- Downside: No resources, no intel, no backup plan

---

### PARTY DELIBERATION (Testing Level 1 Party Dynamics)

**Kessa (impatient):** *"I vote we go now. Every hour we wait, that thing down there gets more awake."*

**Elrik (cautious):** *"Without intel? That's how you join the four dead miners. I want to talk to the survivors first—understand what we're walking into."*

**Nyra (pragmatic):** *"I agree with Elrik. The families will talk to me—I've been helping with funeral rites. Give me one hour. Then we go, with or without the Council's blessing."*

**Roots (listening):** *"The spirits grow more restless as we delay. But... wisdom asks for preparation. I will prepare rituals while Nyra speaks with the grieving."*

**Kessa (frustrated but yielding):** *"Fine. One hour. But if the ground shakes again before then, I'm going—and you can catch up."*

**PARTY CHOOSES OPTION B: Interview Survivors/Families (1-hour intelligence gathering)**

---

## Scene 3: Voices of the Dead (Survivor Interviews)

### Narrative Setup

> **You split up to maximize efficiency:**
>
> **Nyra approaches the shrine where she helped with funeral rites. Three widows sit in vigil, holding candles for husbands who died in the collapse. They recognize her immediately—the quiet half-elf with silver-streaked hair who sang the songs of Aralys while others looked away.**
>
> **Elrik heads to the militia barracks where the eight surviving miners are being kept "for their safety" (really: quarantine, to prevent panic from spreading). Captain Torvald is reluctant but allows Elrik entry after seeing his scholar's credentials and hearing his credentials.**
>
> **Roots walks to the town's edge where old standing stones mark a pre-town settlement. Spirits linger there—older, wiser, less afraid of the present. They might remember the temple's original purpose.**
>
> **Kessa doesn't interview anyone. She climbs to the town's highest point—the old watchtower—and studies the western hills where The Delve rises. Tactical reconnaissance. Know the ground before you fight on it.**

---

### Interview 1: NYRA & THE WIDOWS (Social Intelligence)

**Nyra sits with the three widows in the candlelit shrine. She doesn't ask questions immediately—she just sits, holds hands, witnesses their grief. Shadow Affinity teaches patience. The dying and the grieving will speak when ready.**

**After ten minutes of silence, one widow (Marta, elderly human) speaks:**

> **Marta:** *"My Joram was so excited when they broke through. He came home covered in dust, grinning like a boy. 'Marta,' he said, 'we found it. The old temple. Just like the legends said. It's ENORMOUS.' "*
>
> **Marta's voice breaks.** *"The next morning he went back down. They wanted to map the chamber, secure the entrance, make sure it was safe before bringing up valuables."*
>
> **She clutches Nyra's hand tighter.** *"He never came back up. The collapse... they said it was instantaneous. But the survivors said..."*
>
> **She trails off.**

**Nyra (gentle):** *"What did the survivors say? It's important, Marta. I need to understand what happened to him."*

**Influence Check (Moderate 3+)** - asking the grieving to relive trauma requires gentleness:

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[2]** → **0 successes** (needs 2 for Moderate)

**Failure.** Marta closes up, shaking her head. *"I can't. It hurts too much."*

**Nyra considers using AFFINITY DIE** - this is important information, and helping the grieving is core to her Shadow Affinity:
- *"I'm offering mercy by understanding your husband's death. Let me witness his story."*
- **CONDITIONS MET:** Offering mercy to the dying/grieving, honoring the dead
- **Nyra earns 1 Affinity Die** (max 1 at Level 1)
- **Nyra SPENDS that Affinity Die immediately on the reroll:**

**New roll:** 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Affinity Die - does NOT burn HD on 1s) = **[4] + [6]** → **2 successes**

**SUCCESS!**

Marta takes a shuddering breath and continues:

> **Marta:** *"The survivors said... said the collapse wasn't natural. The stone didn't fall—it MOVED. Like it was grabbed from below and pulled down. They heard... singing? Chanting? Something in a language they didn't know."*
>
> **She looks at Nyra with haunted eyes.** *"They said Joram was closest to the chamber's center when it happened. They saw him pulled down into the darkness. Not crushed—PULLED. Like hands reaching up from below."*
>
> **Nyra's blood runs cold.**
>
> **Marta:** *"The priest said it was divine punishment. The merchant said it was a cave-in. But I know what my husband's friends saw. Something DOWN THERE is awake. And it's hungry."*

**CRITICAL INTEL GAINED:**
- The collapse was NOT geological—it was ACTIVE
- Something grabbed/pulled miners into the darkness
- Survivors heard singing/chanting in unknown language
- The entity (whatever it is) demonstrated intentional action

**Nyra thanks Marta, leaves a silver token (her own memorial piece), and departs with grim understanding.**

---

### Interview 2: ELRIK & THE SURVIVORS (Investigation)

**The militia barracks smell of fear-sweat and sleeplessness. Eight miners sit on cots, wrapped in blankets despite the warm afternoon. Some stare at nothing. Others rock back and forth, muttering. Captain Torvald warned Elrik: "They haven't been coherent. Trauma does that."**

**Elrik approaches the most alert-looking survivor—a young dwarf woman (Kessa—different Kessa, not party member) with bandaged hands and hollow eyes.**

**Elrik (calm, scholarly):** *"My name is Elrik Canmore. I'm not from the Council—I'm here to help. Can you tell me what you saw down there?"*

**Investigation Check (Moderate 3+)** - extracting coherent details from traumatized witness:

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[3]** → **1 success** (needs 2 for Moderate)

**Partial success** - she talks, but it's fragmented:

> **Survivor Kessa:** *"The chamber... so big. Pillars. Carvings. Beautiful, really. We were mapping it when... when the pillars started GLOWING. Not torchlight—GLOWING. Blue-green, like deep ocean water."*
>
> **She shudders.** *"Then the floor cracked. Not collapsed—CRACKED. Like something underneath pushed UP. We ran, but Joram... Joram was standing in the center. He was... staring at something. Mesmerized."*
>
> **She starts rocking again.** *"The floor opened and hands—stone hands? Shadows? I don't know—grabbed him. Pulled him down. We heard singing. The pillars were SINGING."*
>
> ***"I ran. I'm a coward. I ran and left them there."***

**Elrik (gently):** *"You survived. That's not cowardice—that's DATA. You're helping me understand what we're dealing with."*

**He tries to get more specific details—uses Scholar's Method Path ability:**

**Recall Lore (already used this long rest)** - Can't use again until next long rest.

**Alternative: Investigation to cross-reference her testimony with historical records:**

Elrik pulls out his journal with notes from town archives. He reads aloud: *"Khuldras, god of the Deep Foundation—pre-Schism earth deity. Associated with stone guardians, ley-node temples, and... oh."*

**What he reads:** *"...sacred sites often featured CHOIR PILLARS—structures that resonated with cosmic frequencies to stabilize reality. Unauthorized entry would trigger guardian protocols."*

**Elrik looks at the survivor.** *"The pillars were singing because they detected intruders. You activated a defense mechanism."*

**Survivor Kessa (horrified):** *"You mean... it was protecting itself? We weren't attacked—we TRESPASSED?"*

**Elrik:** *"Possibly. Or something sealed inside is using the temple's defenses to communicate. Either way—knowledge is key."*

**CRITICAL INTEL GAINED:**
- The chamber has glowing pillars (likely Choir Pillars—ley-node resonators)
- The floor opened deliberately (not structural collapse)
- Entity demonstrated intelligence (targeted specific miner, used temple mechanisms)
- The temple may have active guardian protocols

---

### Interview 3: ROOTS & THE OLD SPIRITS (Spiritual Communion)

**The standing stones at Stonebridge's edge predate the town by centuries—moss-covered monoliths that mark burial grounds, ritual sites, or territorial boundaries. Roots-Between-Stone kneels in their center, pressing both palms to the earth.**

**Spiritual Guidance (Passive)** activates automatically:
- Detects spirits within 30 yards
- **What Roots senses:** Dozens of faint presences—generations of Stonebridge's dead, lingering peacefully. But beneath them, older spirits: the original stone-layers, the earth-singers, the foundation-keepers who built this settlement on sacred ground.

**Roots speaks aloud in Sylvan (ancient language of the Accord):** *"Ancients of this place. I am Roots-Between-Stone, child of the Verdant-Mother. I ask permission to learn what was sealed beneath."*

**Influence Check (Moderate 3+)** - requesting aid from ancient spirits:

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[1]** → **0 successes** (needs 2 for Moderate)

**FAILURE—and burned 1 HD on the 1!**

**Current HD: 4d8** (was 5d8)

**The spirits recoil. The eldest presence—something vast and slow—responds not with words but with EMOTION:**

- **ANGER.** The seal was NECESSARY.
- **FEAR.** The thing beneath MUST NOT wake fully.
- **REGRET.** The miners were warned by signs they could not read.

**Roots staggers back, overwhelmed. The spirits are afraid—and spirits that survived 800 years don't fear easily.**

**But then, quieter presence approaches. A younger spirit—recent death. Roots recognizes the signature: One of the four dead miners.**

**The miner's spirit (Joram) speaks:**

> *"Too late to run. It SAW us. It knows the seal is broken. You can't re-seal it—the pillars are already singing the unsealing hymn. But... but maybe you can LET IT OUT. Maybe it just wants to be FREE."*
>
> ***"Or maybe it wants revenge for 800 years in the dark."***

**The spirit fades.**

**Roots opens their eyes, visibly shaken. Moss on their fur has wilted slightly. They burned HD trying to force communion—the spirits did not want to speak.**

**CRITICAL INTEL GAINED:**
- The seal was NECESSARY (ancient spirits confirm danger)
- The entity is already awakening—re-sealing may be impossible
- Joram's spirit suggests: "Let it out" (intentional release vs catastrophic breach?)
- Unknown: Is the entity imprisoned for protection or punishment?

---

### Interview 4: KESSA & THE TERRAIN (Tactical Scouting)

**From the watchtower's peak, Kessa studies the western hills. The Delve rises like a scar on the landscape—massive excavation, wooden scaffolding, mine-cart rails leading down into darkness.**

**Battle Sense (Passive) applies to environmental tactics:**

**Awareness Check (Basic 2+) + Battle Sense (+2d6):**

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof) + 2d6 (Battle Sense) = **[5] + [2] + [4]** → **3 successes**

**EXCELLENT SUCCESS!**

**Kessa's tactical assessment:**

1. **Approach Vectors:**
   - **Main road:** Guarded (3 militia), but easily bypassed via hills (north/south routes)
   - **Mine entrance:** Open scaffolding visible—no door, just wooden reinforcement and rope descent system
   - **Escape routes:** Cart rails could serve as quick upward climb if needed

2. **Environmental Hazards:**
   - **The tremors have destabilized scaffolding**—wooden supports show stress cracks
   - **Loose rock** visible around Shaft #7's exterior (recent shifting)
   - **No secondary exits visible** from surface (if we go down, we come back up the same way—or we don't)

3. **Timing:**
   - **Guard shift changes late afternoon** (~2 hours from now)—that's optimal entry window
   - **Tremors seem to follow ~3-4 hour intervals**—next one due within 1-2 hours
   - **If we enter during a tremor, scaffolding could collapse while we're descending**

4. **Critical tactical insight:**
   - **This is a ONE-WAY MISSION unless we're back before the next major tremor.**
   - **If the structure collapses while we're inside, we're trapped.**
   - **"Trapped Below" variant just became VERY real.**

**Kessa grins despite the danger.** *"Finally—something that might kill me. Let's see if it tries hard enough."*

---

## Scene 4: Party Reconvenes (Information Synthesis & Decision)

### Narrative

> **One hour later, the four of you meet at the town's edge—far enough from the Council's shouting to think clearly.**
>
> **You share what you've learned.**

**Nyra (grim):** *"The collapse wasn't geological. Something GRABBED the miners. Pulled them into darkness. Survivors heard singing—chanting in an unknown language."*

**Elrik (analyzing):** *"The chamber has Choir Pillars—ley-node resonators. They activated when the miners entered, which means the temple's defenses are ACTIVE. Whatever's down there is using the architecture to communicate—or defend itself."*

**Roots (troubled):** *"The ancient spirits are terrified. They say the seal was necessary. They say we cannot re-seal it—the pillars are already singing the unsealing hymn. One spirit suggested we... let it out. Intentional release instead of catastrophic breach."*

**Kessa (tactical):** *"The scaffolding's unstable. We have maybe a 2-hour window before the next tremor. If we're inside when it hits, we might get trapped. And there's only one way in—which means one way out."*

**Silence.**

**Elrik:** *"So our options are: Let it wake catastrophically and destroy the town, or... descend and attempt controlled release?"*

**Nyra:** *"Or seal it properly—though the spirits say that's impossible now."*

**Roots:** *"Or speak with it. Learn what it wants. Everything that lives—or once lived—can be understood."*

**Kessa:** *"Or kill it, if it's killable."*

**Another silence.**

**Elrik (pragmatic):** *"We're Level 1. We have 24 HD between us. If this is a god-level entity, we can't fight it."*

**Nyra:** *"Then we don't fight. We WITNESS. We understand. We find another way."*

**Roots:** *"Renewal teaches: All things transform. Perhaps this entity needs to complete its cycle—800 years interrupted."*

**Kessa:** *"Whatever. Are we going or not?"*

**Nyra, Elrik, and Roots exchange looks.**

**Elrik:** *"We're going. But we prepare first."*

---

### Preparation Phase (30 minutes)

**SUPPLIES GATHERED** (without Council backing—improvised):

**Nyra:**
- Ritually prepares **Magical Armor** (Basic Ritual - FREE, no roll required)
  - **Tactical Decision:** Who gets the single 2d12 armor layer?
  - **Choice:** Casts on **Kessa** (the tank who will take the most hits)
  - Rationale: Nyra's Shadow Affinity teaches protecting others; Kessa's role demands front-line durability
  - Duration: Until destroyed (cannot be mended, only re-cast)
  - **Limit:** Only 1 magical armor active per caster
- Prepares silver tokens as emergency spirit wards (narrative items)

**Elrik:**
- Uses **Cartographer's Tools** to sketch approach route, mark guard positions, plan escape vectors
- Uses **Herbalist's Kit** to identify local plants with medicinal properties, creates makeshift:
  - **1 Minor Healing Poultice** (restores 1d4 HD when consumed, Basic action)
- Prepares rope, torches, and rations for descent

**Roots:**
- Performs ritual prayer to Thymera, asking guidance for transformation/renewal
- Uses **Voice of the Accord** to request aid from local wildlife:
  - **Wild-Touched Path ability:** Calls **Beast Companion** (1/long rest)
  - **A large raven appears**, perches on Roots' antlers
  - Raven has **1 HD** (half level, minimum 1), can scout ahead, report danger

**Kessa:**
- Sharpens weapons, checks armor straps, mentally rehearses blade patterns
- **Path ability: Unyielding** already active (passive bonuses)
- Mentally prepares **Grit** reaction (1/short rest - stay at 1 HD when dropping to 0)

**RESOURCES BEFORE DESCENT:**
- **HD:** Nyra 5d6, Roots 4d8 (burned 1 earlier), Kessa 6d10, Elrik 5d8
- **Resolve:** All at 5/5
- **Magical Armor:** Kessa has 2d12 outer layer (Nyra's free ritual), others only have base armor
- **Special:** Healing poultice (1d4 HD), Raven companion (1 HD scout), Silver spirit wards

---

### The Approach (Bypassing Guards)

**Kessa's tactical plan: Approach via north hills during guard shift lull, descend before next tremor.**

**GROUP STEALTH CHECK (Moderate 3+)** - bypassing three militia guards:

**Nyra (Shadow-Trained):** 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Path bonus in shadows) = **[4] + [3]** → **2 successes** ✓

**Roots (large firbolg, disadvantage but experienced):** 1d6 (Prof) = **[2]** → **0 successes** ✗

**Kessa (practical fighter, not stealthy):** 1d6 (Prof) = **[5]** → **1 success** (needs 2)

**Elrik (light armor, ranger training):** 1d6 (Prof) = **[6]** → **1 success** (needs 2)

**MIXED SUCCESS** - Nyra succeeds, but Roots/Kessa/Elrik make noise.

**One guard notices movement in the hills. He calls out:** *"Hey! Who's there? The western road is CLOSED!"*

**Quick decision:**

**Kessa (stepping forward boldly):** *"We're going into the mine. You can try to stop us, or you can let us solve your tremor problem."*

**Influence Check (Moderate 3+):**

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[4]** → **1 success** (needs 2)

**FAILURE.** The guard reaches for his horn (to call reinforcements).

**Nyra (stepping from shadows beside him, QUIET):** *"Do you want more people to die? Or do you want someone who actually understands what's happening to fix it?"*

**Her voice carries the weight of Shadow Affinity—mercy through endings, witness to death.**

**Influence Check (Moderate 3+):**

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[1]** → **0 successes**, burns 1 HD!

**Current HD: 4d6** (was 5d6)

**FAILURE AGAIN.** The guard blows the horn—

**—but Roots places one massive hand on the guard's shoulder.**

**Roots (calm, inevitable as seasons):** *"The earth is crying. We go to listen. You... should step aside."*

**Influence Check (Moderate 3+) + Voice of the Accord (nature recognizes its own):**

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[5]** → **1 success** (needs 2)

**STILL NOT ENOUGH—but then Elrik steps forward with SCROLL FROM TOWN ARCHIVES (improvised prop):**

**Elrik:** *"We have historical precedent—Khuldras temples require SANCTIONED entry. We're scholars of the Accord. Let us pass on religious grounds."*

**This is utter bullshit, but it sounds official.**

**Influence Check (Moderate 3+) + Scholar's Method (+2d6 to Lore):**

Wait, this isn't Lore—this is Influence. But Elrik's carrying himself with academic authority.

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[3]** → **1 success** (needs 2)

**STILL FAILING.**

**The guard hesitates—horn halfway to lips—**

**Kessa (frustrated, drawing sword): "*Look. Either you let us go fix this, or the next tremor collapses the town and you die anyway. CHOOSE."*

**Intimidation Check (Moderate 3+):**

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[2]** → **0 successes**

**COMPLETE PARTY FAILURE.**

**The guard blows the horn. ALARM RAISED.**

---

### Consequences: Running Entry (Variant Approach)

> **The horn's blast echoes across Stonebridge. Shouts rise from the town. More guards will arrive within minutes.**
>
> **Kessa grins.** *"Well, THAT didn't work. New plan: RUN."*

**The party SPRINTS for the mine entrance—no more stealth, just speed.**

**ATHLETICS CHECK (Basic 2+)** - racing to Shaft #7 before guards catch up:

**Nyra:** 1d6 = **[5]** → **1 success** ✓ (fast and light)  
**Roots:** 1d6 = **[4]** → **1 success** ✓ (long firbolg strides)  
**Kessa:** 1d6 = **[6]** → **1 success** ✓ (combat fitness)  
**Elrik:** 1d6 = **[3]** → **1 success** ✓ (ranger endurance)

**EVERYONE SUCCEEDS!**

> **You reach the mine entrance—scaffolding creaking ominously—as guards pour from the town behind you. Captain Torvald himself shouts:** ***"STOP! You don't have authorization! It's not SAFE!"***
>
> **Kessa turns, salutes mockingly—her body shimmering with faint arcane light from Nyra's protective ritual—and JUMPS into the shaft.**
>
> **Nyra follows without hesitation—silver tokens jingling, trusting light armor and shadow-craft to protect her.**
>
> **Elrik grabs a rope, loops it around the descent pulley system, and slides down.**
>
> **Roots pauses at the edge, looks back at the furious guards, and speaks:**
>
> ***"We return the cycle to balance. Or we do not return."***
>
> **The firbolg steps backward into darkness.**

**The raven companion SHRIEKS and dives after them.**

**Behind, Captain Torvald reaches the scaffolding—but the guards won't follow. They've seen what happened to the miners.**

**Torvald shouts down into the darkness:** ***"If you die down there, don't haunt ME!"***

---

## Descent Into the Hollow Below

### Narrative

> **The rope descent is 400 feet. Darkness swallows you after the first 50.**
>
> **Elrik lights a torch. The flickering flame reveals:**
>
> - **Mine cart rails** bolted to the shaft walls, descending in spirals
> - **Wooden support beams** showing stress cracks from recent tremors
> - **Tool marks** where miners carved this passage over years
> - **And below—far below—a faint BLUE-GREEN GLOW**

**The descent takes ~10 minutes (simulated). No checks required—just atmospheric tension.**

**Halfway down:**

> **The walls change. Natural stone becomes CARVED stone. The tool marks vanish, replaced by deliberate architecture—smooth surfaces, precise angles, ancient glyphs.**
>
> **Elrik (hushed):** *"We just passed from the mine into the temple proper. The miners broke through HERE."* *(Points to jagged hole where pickaxes shattered ancient seals)*

**Roots trails fingers along the glyphs. Voice of the Accord allows intuitive understanding:**

> **Roots:** *"Warnings. 'Here sleeps the foundation. Do not wake the stone. Do not break the accord.' "* *(Pauses)* *"We are not the first to ignore this."*

**At 300 feet:**

> **A tremor.**
>
> **The FOURTH TREMOR of the day.**
>
> **The shaft SHAKES. Wooden beams groan. Dust and small stones rain down. Kessa clutches the rope, swaying—her Magical Armor shimmers as small debris bounces harmlessly off the arcane barrier. Nyra presses against the wall in shadow, trusting her reflexes. Roots and Elrik grip tight.**
>
> **The tremor lasts 20 seconds—longer than the previous. The blue-green glow below BRIGHTENS.**

**RESOLVE CHECK (Moderate 3+)** - keeping calm during terrifying descent:

**Nyra:** 1d6 = **[4]** → **1 success** (needs 2) - holds steady but shaken  
**Roots:** 1d6 = **[2]** → **0 successes** - antlers scrape wall, nearly loses grip  
**Kessa (Unyielding - succeeds on 4+ instead of 5+):** 1d6 = **[4]** → **SUCCESS** ✓  
**Elrik:** 1d6 = **[5]** → **1 success** (needs 2) - grips rope tighter, heart pounding

**No one falls, but everyone is RATTLED.**

**As the tremor subsides:**

> **The raven companion SHRIEKS from below—warning call.**
>
> **Roots:** *"The spirits grow louder. Something is... LISTENING."*

---

### Arrival: The Chamber of Choir Pillars

**At 400 feet, the shaft opens into VASTNESS.**

> **Your torchlight is a pinprick against the ENORMOUS chamber stretching before you.**
>
> **DESCRIPTION:**
>
> - **Size:** Football-field large, ceiling 60+ feet high (carved from living bedrock)
> - **Pillars:** Twelve massive stone columns arranged in a circle, each ~20 feet tall, covered in glowing glyphs (blue-green bioluminescent lichen or... magic?)
> - **Floor:** Smooth black stone etched with concentric circles radiating from the CENTER
> - **Center:** A raised platform with a MASSIVE STONE SEAL—circular, 15 feet across, carved with the symbol of Khuldras (mountains supporting the sky)
> - **The Breach:** The miners' pickaxe marks scar the seal's edge. Cracks spider-web across its surface. The cracks GLOW faintly, pulsing like a heartbeat.
> - **Atmosphere:** The air thrums with LOW-FREQUENCY SOUND—the "singing" survivors described. It's coming from the PILLARS.

**Elrik (awed):** *"Choir Pillars. Twelve of them. This is a MAJOR ley-node. The cosmic force channeled here would be... immense."*

**Nyra activates Weave Sight (Passive):**

> **What she sees:** The Weave here is NOT disrupted—it's STRUCTURED. The pillars are singing IN HARMONY, channeling cosmic force into the seal. But the seal is cracked. The harmony is degrading. As she watches, one pillar's glow flickers slightly—off-rhythm.

**Nyra:** *"The seal isn't just broken—it's FAILING ACTIVELY. The ley-node is trying to hold, but the damage is too severe."*

**Roots (Spiritual Guidance activates):**

> **What they sense:** The chamber is FLOODED with spirits. Hundreds—no, THOUSANDS—of presences. Not hostile, but... BOUND. Trapped in the stone itself. And beneath them all, something VAST is breathing.

**Roots (horrified whisper):** *"The seal doesn't just lock something in. It's MADE of bound spirits. Thousands of them. They've been holding this for 800 years."*

**Kessa:** *"And we just sentenced them all to death by letting miners crack it. Great."*

---

### Scene End - Cliffhanger

> **As you stand at the chamber's edge, the cracked seal PULSES.**
>
> **The singing from the pillars RISES IN PITCH.**
>
> **And from beneath the seal—far below, impossibly deep—a VOICE.**
>
> **Not words. Not language. Just... RECOGNITION.**
>
> ***Something knows you're here.***
>
> **The raven on Roots' shoulder SCREAMS and takes flight, circling frantically.**
>
> **Elrik (urgent):** *"The ley-node is destabilizing faster now. Our presence—our ATTENTION—is accelerating the unsealing."*
>
> **Nyra:** *"Then we have minutes, not hours."*
>
> **Kessa (drawing her sword):** *"Good. I hate waiting."*
>
> **Roots kneels, pressing both palms to the floor:** *"I will try to speak with it. Perhaps it can be reasoned with."*
>
> **A FIFTH TREMOR—stronger than all the others—ROCKS THE CHAMBER.**
>
> **One Choir Pillar's glow SPUTTERS and DIES.**
>
> **The seal cracks WIDER.**
>
> **Something is COMING.**

## Playtest Metrics & Analysis

### Resources Expended

**Hit Dice Burned:**
- Nyra: 1 HD burned (rolled 1 on Influence check) → **4d6 remaining**
- Roots: 1 HD burned (rolled 1 on spirit communion) → **4d8 remaining**
- Kessa: 0 HD burned → **6d10 remaining**
- Elrik: 0 HD burned → **5d8 remaining**

**Total Party HD:** 19/24 remaining (79%)

**Resolve Spent:** None yet (all at 5/5)

**Affinity Dice:**
- Nyra earned + immediately spent 1 Affinity Die (helping widow) → **0 stored**
- Others: 0 earned yet

**Magical Armor Status:**
- **Kessa only** has 2d12 outer layer (Nyra's free ritual—limit 1 per caster)
- Others rely on base armor: Nyra 2d6, Roots 2d8, Elrik 2d6

**Special Resources Used:**
- Elrik: Recall Lore (1/long rest) - EXPENDED
- Roots: Beast Companion (1/long rest) - ACTIVE (raven, 1 HD)
- Kessa: War Cry (1/short rest) - NOT USED YET
- Nyra: Shadow-Trained stealth bonus - USED

---

### Mechanical Testing Notes

**Path Board Diversity:**
- ✓ **Shadow-Trained** (Nyra): Stealth bonus worked well in dim conditions
- ✓ **Wild-Touched** (Roots): Beast companion provided narrative utility (raven scout)
- ✓ **Unyielding** (Kessa): Easier Resolve checks (4+ threshold) not tested yet
- ✓ **Scholar's Method** (Elrik): Recall Lore provided critical ley-node intel

**Level 1 Challenges Observed:**
- **Low Prof dice (1d6) made Moderate checks (3+) VERY difficult** - party failed most social rolls
- **Limited resources** - only 2 HD burned so far, but social failures forced riskier approach
- **No Ultimate abilities** - party lacks high-tier options for complex problems
- **Magical Armor ritual was CLUTCH** - free 2d12 defense layer before descent

**Affinity System Working:**
- Nyra earning Affinity Die through compassionate action felt narratively satisfying
- Immediate spend-back created dramatic moment (widow interview success)
- Distinction from Exertion Dice (safe vs risky) is mechanically clear

**Shaman Class (FIRST PLAYTEST):**
- **Spiritual Guidance** provided unique intel (bound spirits in seal)
- **Voice of the Accord** gave intuitive glyph-reading
- **Ancestral Blessing** not used yet (combat/crisis ability)
- **Wild-Touched Path** synergy with Shaman class felt thematic

**Party Dynamics:**
- Four personalities created richer deliberation than 3-person party
- No established leader → more democratic (slower but more thorough)
- Kessa's impatience vs Elrik's caution created good tension
- Roots' spiritual wisdom balanced Nyra's pragmatic mercy

---

### Variant Testing: Trapped Below

**Mechanics Introduced:**
- Party descended BEFORE securing safe return route
- Guards alerted → town knows they're down there but won't help
- Scaffolding unstable → exit route potentially compromised
- Tremors increasing → time pressure is REAL
- **No Recover available** - only Rest (½ HD, ½ Resolve in threatened space)

**Cumulative Attrition:**
- 5 HD burned so far (all from failed rolls, not combat)
- Party is NOW TRAPPED 400 feet underground
- Next tremor could seal exit shaft

**This creates VERY different pressure than Playtest 01's "go back anytime" approach.**

---

### Session 2 Setup

**Immediate Objectives:**
1. **Investigate the cracked seal** - What was sealed? Why?
2. **Stabilize or disperse ley-node** - Prevent catastrophic collapse
3. **Communicate with entity (if possible)** - Roots' approach
4. **Survive the unsealing** - Combat likely inevitable

**Complications:**
- Exit route compromised (trapped below)
- Resources limited (19 HD, no healing spells prepared for Roots)
- Entity is AWARE of them
- Choir Pillars failing (one already dead)
- Time pressure (next tremor imminent)

**Expected Leveling:**
- Party will NOT reach Level 2 until AFTER Session 2 (per user's progression timeline)
- Must complete this crisis at Level 1
- Higher difficulty, lower resources = brutal playtest

---

*"Four souls descend into sacred darkness, seeking understanding. They find recognition—and something vast that has waited 800 years to be witnessed. The seal cracks. The choir falters. And beneath the stone, something RISES."*
