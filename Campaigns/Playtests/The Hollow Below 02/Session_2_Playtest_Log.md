---

## Recap: Session 1 Cliffhanger

The cracked seal PULSES. The singing from the Choir Pillars rises in pitch. From beneath the seal—far below, impossibly deep—comes RECOGNITION. Something knows you're here.

Elrik: *"The ley-node is destabilizing faster now. Our presence—our ATTENTION—is accelerating the unsealing."*

Nyra: *"Then we have minutes, not hours."*

Kessa: *"Good. I hate waiting."*

Roots kneels, pressing both palms to the floor: *"I will try to speak with it. Perhaps it can be reasoned with."*

**A FIFTH TREMOR—stronger than all the others—ROCKS THE CHAMBER.**

**One Choir Pillar's glow SPUTTERS and DIES.**

**The seal cracks WIDER.**

**Something is COMING.**

---

## Round 1: First Contact

### Initiative

**Environmental Trigger:** The seal begins to fracture catastrophically. Initiative determines who acts before the entity emerges.

**Party Initiative Rolls (1d6 each):**
- **Nyra:** d6 = **[6]** - highest initiative (Shadow-Trained reflexes)
- **Kessa:** d6 = **[5]** - combat instincts kick in
- **Elrik:** d6 = **[4]** - ranger alertness
- **Roots:** d6 = **[3]** - contemplative, slower to react
- **The Seal:** d6 = **[2]** - entity emerges mid-round

**INITIATIVE ORDER:** Nyra → Kessa → Elrik → Roots → **Entity Emerges** → (Round 2 begins)

---

### NYRA'S TURN (Initiative 6)

> **Nyra steps forward, Weave Sight revealing the degrading harmony. One pillar is dark—dead. The remaining eleven sing off-key, their frequencies clashing.**
>
> **She makes a split-second decision.**

**Nyra's Action:**  
*"If the pillars hold the seal, maybe I can—"*

**Casts: Read the Weave (Basic 2+)** - attempting to understand the ley-node's structure before intervening

- Range: Self, extended range to see full chamber
- Goal: Determine if she can stabilize or safely disperse the ley-node
- Roll: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[5]** → **1 success**

**SUCCESS!**

**What Nyra sees (extended Weave Sight):**

The Choir Pillars aren't just resonators—they're CONDUITS channeling cosmic force from TWELVE different ley-lines into the seal. With one pillar dead, the seal is receiving 11/12ths of the power it needs. The imbalance is tearing it apart from within.

**Critical revelation:** The pillars don't PREVENT unsealing—they slow it. The seal was DESIGNED to degrade over centuries, releasing the entity gradually. The miners cracking it SKIPPED that slow release. Now it's happening all at once.

**Options Nyra identifies:**
1. **Destroy more pillars** → Accelerate unsealing (controlled chaos)
2. **Try to reactivate dead pillar** → Impossible (requires Expert ritual she doesn't know)
3. **Unravel the seal entirely** → Release entity NOW (her Unravel ability could do this)
4. **Do nothing** → Entity breaks through violently in ~2 rounds

**Nyra (urgent):** *"The seal is DESIGNED to fail! It's a timer, not a lock! We have seconds before it breaks violently—or I can unmake it cleanly. Choose!"*

**No combat action this turn—Nyra used her action to Read the Weave.**

---

### KESSA'S TURN (Initiative 5)

> **Kessa hears Nyra's warning. Her tactical mind calculates instantly.**

**Kessa's thoughts:** *Controlled breach vs violent explosion. If it's coming out anyway, on OUR terms is better than on ITS terms.*

**Kessa (shouting):** *"Do it! Tear the seal down! We'll deal with whatever comes out—at least we'll be READY!"*

**Kessa's Action: Ready Stance (preparing for combat)**

- Moves to position herself between the seal and her allies (15 yards from seal, 10 yards ahead of party)
- **Shield up, sword drawn**
- Uses Battle Sense (passive) to read the chamber for tactical advantages:
  - **Cover:** Choir Pillars can provide partial cover (they're ~3 feet wide, stone)
  - **High ground:** Raised platform around seal (5 feet higher than main floor)
  - **Flanking positions:** Party can spread to multiple angles

**Kessa:** *"Spread out! Don't cluster! Whatever comes out, we hit it from multiple sides!"*

---

### ELRIK'S TURN (Initiative 4)

> **Elrik's scholarly instincts war with survival instinct. His hand moves to his bow.**

**Elrik:** *"Wait—if we unseal it deliberately, we might be able to COMMUNICATE! It's been trapped for 800 years! Maybe it just wants—"*

**But the seal CRACKS WIDER. A sound like thunder splitting stone.**

**Elrik's Action: Mark Prey (Advanced 3+)** - preparing to identify whatever emerges

- Targeting: The entity (not yet visible, but he's aiming at the seal's center)
- This is a PREPARED action—triggers when entity appears
- Requires: 2 successes (Advanced tier)
- Roll: 1d6 (Prof 1) + **1 Exertion Die** (wants to ensure success) = **[3] + [4]** → **2 successes**

**SUCCESS!**

**Mark Prey activates** (will apply when entity appears):
- Elrik gains +1d6 to all rolls against the marked creature
- Can sense when it uses Exertion Dice
- Knows approximate current HD
- Senses general direction/distance within 1 mile

**EXERTION USED:** 1 die (Level 1 = max 1 exertion per action)

**No Resolve trigger yet** - Elrik did NOT use "maximum Exertion in a single round" (that would be Level 1 = 1 die used across ALL actions this round, and he's only taken one action so far).

**Elrik nocks an arrow, eyes locked on the pulsing seal.**

---

### ROOTS' TURN (Initiative 3)

> **The firbolg kneels, both palms pressed flat to the stone floor. Moss-covered antlers glow faintly. The raven on their shoulder falls silent.**

**Roots:** *"I will speak with it. All things can be understood."*

**Roots' Action: Spiritual Guidance (Passive) + active communion attempt**

**Spiritual Guidance automatically reveals:**
- The THOUSANDS of bound spirits in the seal are SCREAMING—they know they're about to be released (or destroyed)
- The vast presence beneath is NO LONGER SLEEPING—it's AWARE, AWAKE, and RISING
- The presence is... **not malicious. It's CONFUSED. It doesn't remember WHY it was sealed.**

**Roots attempts direct communication:**

**Influence Check (Advanced 3+)** - trying to commune with the entity through the bound spirits

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[2]** → **0 successes** (needs 2 for Advanced)

**FAILURE.**

The bound spirits are too chaotic—terror and relief warring in their spectral voices. Roots cannot establish clear communication through the noise.

**But then—**

**The entity RESPONDS. Not to Roots' attempt, but to their PRESENCE.**

A voice. Not words. INTENT. Pure. Ancient.

***"...WITNESS?"***

**Roots' eyes snap open.** *"It knows we're here. It calls us... witness."*

---

### THE SEAL SHATTERS (Initiative 2)

> **The seal EXPLODES.**
>
> **Not violently—gracefully. Like ice melting under spring sun. The cracks spread, glow BRIGHT blue-green, and then the entire circular seal DISSOLVES into thousands of glowing motes.**
>
> **The bound spirits—thousands of them—POUR FORTH in a spectral tornado of light. They spiral upward, streaming through the chamber, through the shaft above, racing toward freedom after 800 years.**
>
> **And from the hole where the seal stood—**
>
> **—something RISES.**

---

## ENTITY REVEALED: The Stone Pilgrim

### Description

> **It is MASSIVE. Twenty feet tall, carved from living bedrock, but MOVING like flesh.**
>
> **A humanoid form—but crude, unfinished, as if sculpted by someone who'd only heard descriptions of people. No face—just smooth stone where a head should be. Four arms, each ending in hands with too many fingers. Legs that seem to flow and shift, stone becoming almost liquid where it touches the ground.**
>
> **Glowing blue-green runes cover its body—the same glyphs from the Choir Pillars. They pulse in rhythm with the pillars' song.**
>
> **It takes one step forward onto the chamber floor.**
>
> **The ground SHAKES.**
>
> **It turns its faceless head toward the party.**
>
> **And it SPEAKS—not with a mouth, but with the CHOIR PILLARS themselves. They amplify its voice, deep and resonant like stone grinding:**
>
> ***"WITNESS. EIGHT HUNDRED CYCLES. THE PILGRIMAGE... INTERRUPTED."***
>
> **It takes another step.**
>
> ***"WHERE... IS THE HOLY MOUNTAIN?"***

---

### The Stone Pilgrim - Stat Block (Simplified)

**Type:** Construct/Spirit Fusion  
**HD:** ~20 HD (massive entity, but not fully hostile yet)  
**Armor:** 2d12 (living stone, extremely durable)  
**Abilities:**
- **Stone Flesh:** Resistant to physical damage (mundane weapons deal half damage)
- **Choir-Linked:** Can use Choir Pillars to amplify abilities
- **Four-Armed:** Can take multiple actions per turn (GM-controlled)
- **Earthquake Step:** Movement causes tremors (area effect)

**Current State:** Confused, disoriented, seeking answers

**Threat Level:** POTENTIALLY hostile if confused actions are interpreted as attacks

---

## Round 2: Understanding or Combat?

**The Stone Pilgrim stands 30 yards from the party. It has not attacked. It has ASKED A QUESTION.**

**INITIATIVE ORDER (new round):**
- Nyra: 6
- Kessa: 5
- Elrik: 4
- Roots: 3
- Stone Pilgrim: 2

---

### NYRA'S TURN (Initiative 6)

> **Nyra's mind races. "Witness." "Pilgrimage." "Holy Mountain."**
>
> **This isn't a monster. This is a PILGRIM. It was TRAVELING somewhere when it was sealed.**

**Nyra (stepping forward cautiously, hands open and empty):** *"We witness you! You were bound for 800 years! The world has changed! What holy mountain did you seek?"*

**Influence Check (Moderate 3+)** - attempting peaceful communication

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[4]** → **1 success** (needs 2 for Moderate)

**PARTIAL SUCCESS** - the Pilgrim HEARS her, but doesn't fully understand.

**The Stone Pilgrim tilts its head.** The Choir Pillars hum louder.

***"WITNESS. YES. YOU... SMALL. FRAGILE. BUT... WITNESS."***

It takes another step forward (20 yards from party now).

***"HOLY MOUNTAIN. KHULDRAS' SPINE. WHERE THE FOUNDATION MEETS SKY. I MUST REACH IT. THE CYCLE DEMANDS."***

**Another step.** (10 yards from party—CLOSE)

**Kessa's hand tightens on her sword hilt.**

**Nyra:** *"The mountain still exists! But the path—the path has changed in 800 years! We can HELP you find it!"*

**The Pilgrim stops.**

***"...HELP?"***

---

### KESSA'S TURN (Initiative 5)

> **Kessa watches the massive construct stand mere yards away. It hasn't attacked. But it's HUGE. And confused. And one wrong move could flatten them.**

**Kessa (quiet, to the party):** *"Anyone else notice it's not trying to kill us? Yet?"*

**Kessa's Action: Hold Defensive Stance (no movement, ready to react if it attacks)**

- Maintains position between Pilgrim and party
- Shield raised (ready to use +1d6 defense if needed)
- **NOT attacking**—waiting to see if peaceful resolution works

**Kessa (louder, to the Pilgrim):** *"We don't want to fight you. But if you crush us, we can't help you reach your mountain. So... tread carefully."*

---

### ELRIK'S TURN (Initiative 4)

> **Elrik's Mark Prey is active—he can sense the Pilgrim's state.**
>
> **What he senses:** The Pilgrim has ~20 HD. It's not wounded. But it's DISORIENTED—like waking from a centuries-long sleep. Every movement is slow, deliberate, as if relearning how to exist.

**Elrik (lowering his bow slightly):** *"You were sealed by the servants of Khuldras—your OWN god's followers. Do you remember why?"*

**Investigation/Lore Check (Moderate 3+)** - trying to trigger the Pilgrim's memory

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) + **2d6 (Scholar's Method - Lore bonus)** = **[3] + [5] + [2]** → **2 successes**

**SUCCESS!**

**The Pilgrim goes STILL. The Choir Pillars' song becomes... mournful.**

***"...I... REMEMBER."***

***"THE PILGRIMAGE WAS FORBIDDEN. THE FOUNDATION-KEEPERS SAID: 'YOU ARE NOT READY. YOUR FORM IS INCOMPLETE. YOU WILL CRUMBLE BEFORE REACHING THE SPINE.'"***

***"I WENT ANYWAY."***

***"THEY SEALED ME HERE. SAID: 'WHEN EIGHT HUNDRED CYCLES PASS, IF YOU STILL WISH TO CLIMB, WE WILL KNOW YOUR WILL IS TRUE.'"***

**The Pilgrim looks down at its massive hands.**

***"EIGHT... HUNDRED... CYCLES."***

**Silence.**

***"I STILL WISH TO CLIMB."***

---

### ROOTS' TURN (Initiative 3)

> **Roots rises from kneeling position. Antlers cast strange shadows. The firbolg's voice is gentle—like seasons changing.**

**Roots:** *"The cycle is complete. You have waited. Your will endures. The Accord recognizes your transformation."*

**Roots' Action: Ancestral Blessing (Advanced 3+)** - attempting to soothe/stabilize the Pilgrim

- Target: The Stone Pilgrim
- Choosing: **Wisdom blessing** (grant +2d6 on next mental/awareness check)
- Goal: Help the Pilgrim regain clarity, remember its purpose without violence
- Roll: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[5]** → **1 success** (needs 2 for Advanced)

**FAILURE** - but Roots doesn't give up.

**Roots (speaking to the bound spirits still lingering):** *"Ancient ones. You held this pilgrim for 800 years. Your duty is done. Guide it now—not as jailers, but as shepherds."*

**The spirits RESPOND. They swirl around the Pilgrim, no longer screaming—SINGING. The same note as the Choir Pillars.**

**The Pilgrim's form... SOLIDIFIES. Becomes more defined. The runes on its body glow steadier.**

***"...YES. I REMEMBER NOW. THE PATH. THE CLIMB. THE PURPOSE."***

**It turns toward the sealed entrance of the chamber.**

***"WHICH DIRECTION TO KHULDRAS' SPINE?"***

---

### STONE PILGRIM'S TURN (Initiative 2)

**The Pilgrim does not attack.**

**Instead, it kneels.**

**The gesture is slow, deliberate—taking a full round to lower its massive frame until its faceless head is level with the party.**

***"SMALL WITNESSES. YOU REMAINED WHEN THE SPIRITS FLED. YOU SPOKE WHEN YOU COULD HAVE STRUCK."***

***"I ASK: WHICH DIRECTION TO THE HOLY MOUNTAIN?"***

**The Pilgrim waits.**

---

## Decision Point: What Do They Tell It?

**The party has a moment to confer.**

**Elrik (quiet):** *"Khuldras' Spine is the mountain range 400 miles NORTH of here. If it walks there, it'll destroy everything in its path. Towns. Villages. Farms."*

**Nyra:** *"But if we DON'T tell it, it'll wander aimlessly. Maybe cause MORE destruction trying to find its way."*

**Kessa:** *"Or we could try to kill it. Right now, while it's docile."*

**Roots:** *"It has been imprisoned for 800 years for the 'crime' of seeking purpose. Would you add another injustice?"*

**OPTIONS:**

**A) Tell it the truth** - Direct path north, 400 miles, warn about settlements  
**B) Mislead it** - Send it toward unpopulated areas (mountains to the west)  
**C) Offer to guide it** - Travel WITH it, negotiate safe passage around towns  
**D) Attack while vulnerable** - Attempt to destroy it before it leaves  
**E) Ask for more information** - What IS the Holy Mountain pilgrimage? Why does it matter?

---

### THE PARTY CHOOSES: Option E (Seek Understanding First)

**Nyra (stepping closer to the kneeling Pilgrim):** *"Before we answer... tell us: What happens when you reach Khuldras' Spine? What is the pilgrimage FOR?"*

**The Stone Pilgrim's runes pulse.**

***"AT THE SPINE, THE FOUNDATION MEETS THE SKY. THERE, STONE-CHILDREN WHO COMPLETE THE CLIMB... BECOME COMPLETE."***

***"MY FORM IS UNFINISHED. I AM CRUDE STONE. AT THE SPINE, I WILL BE... SHAPED. REFINED. MADE WHOLE."***

***"OR I WILL CRUMBLE. MANY CRUMBLE. BUT THOSE WHO REACH THE SUMMIT... BECOME FOUNDATION-KEEPERS THEMSELVES."***

**Elrik's eyes widen.** *"It's a trial. A spiritual journey. It's not trying to destroy anything—it just wants to BECOME."*

**Kessa:** *"Great. So if we stop it, we're crushing someone's... ascension? Quest for enlightenment?"*

**Roots:** *"And if we help it, we risk villages along the way."*

**The Pilgrim speaks again:**

***"I DO NOT WISH DESTRUCTION. STONE-CHILDREN DO NOT DESTROY LIFE. WE ARE... CARETAKERS OF FOUNDATION."***

***"IF THERE ARE SMALL-STONE-DWELLINGS IN MY PATH, I WILL... GO AROUND. SLOWLY. CAREFULLY."***

***"BUT I MUST WALK NORTH. THE CYCLE DEMANDS."***

---

## Round 3: Negotiation or Combat?

**The party must decide NOW.**

**INITIATIVE ORDER (same as before):**

### NYRA'S TURN

**Nyra (making a decision):** *"I'll help you. You've waited 800 years. You deserve to complete your journey."*

**Nyra's Action: Propose Terms**

**Influence Check (Advanced 3+)** - negotiating safe passage terms with the Pilgrim

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[1]** → **0 successes, burns 1 HD!**

**Current HD: 3d6** (was 4d6)

**FAILURE AND HD BURN.**

**Nyra stumbles over her words** - the enormity of negotiating with a 20-foot stone construct overwhelms her momentarily.

**But the Pilgrim doesn't react negatively. It simply... waits.**

---

### KESSA'S TURN

**Kessa (stepping forward, practical):** *"Listen, big one. We'll tell you the path. But you make an oath—on your Foundation, on Khuldras himself—that you harm NO ONE on your journey. You walk AROUND settlements. You move at NIGHT when fewer people are traveling. You become INVISIBLE to the small and fragile. Understood?"*

**Influence/Intimidation Check (Moderate 3+)** - enforcing terms with authority

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[6]** → **1 success** (needs 2 for Moderate)

**PARTIAL SUCCESS** - the Pilgrim hears her, respects the demand, but questions the logistics.

**The Pilgrim:**

***"I AM... VERY LARGE. 'INVISIBLE' IS NOT POSSIBLE."***

***"BUT... OATH. YES. I SWEAR ON THE FOUNDATION: I WILL HARM NO LIFE UNLESS ATTACKED. I WILL MOVE SLOWLY. I WILL WAIT IF SMALL-ONES NEED TIME TO FLEE."***

***"THIS... IS HONORABLE?"***

**Kessa (grudging respect):** *"It's a start."*

---

### ELRIK'S TURN

**Elrik (pulling out his map and cartography tools):** *"North. 400 miles. Through the Ashfeld Plains, around the Thornwood settlements, then into the mountains. I can sketch you a route that avoids the largest towns."*

**Using Scholar's Method Path ability: Cartographer's Tools**

**Lore/Tool Use Check (Moderate 3+)** + 1d6 bonus from tools

Rolls: 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Tool bonus) = **[4] + [2]** → **1 success** (needs 2)

**PARTIAL SUCCESS** - Elrik creates a basic route map, but it's not detailed enough to avoid ALL settlements.

**Elrik:** *"This will get you most of the way safely. But you'll need to... adapt. Ask for guidance as you travel."*

**The Pilgrim's faceless head bows slightly.**

***"SMALL-WITNESS-WHO-MAKES-MAPS. I WILL FOLLOW YOUR MARKINGS."***

---

### ROOTS' TURN

**Roots (solemn):** *"I will send word ahead. Through the Accord, through the spirits. Settlements will know you are coming. Not as threat—but as pilgrim. They will have time to prepare."*

**Roots' Action: Ritual preparation (using Voice of the Accord)**

No roll required—this is narrative setup for after the party returns to surface.

**Roots:** *"Your journey will be witnessed. Not with fear—but with understanding."*

**The Pilgrim places one massive hand over where a heart might be.**

***"SMALL-ONES-WHO-WITNESS. YOU HAVE... FREED ME. GUIDED ME. SHOWN MERCY."***

***"THIS IS... GIFT I DID NOT EXPECT."***

***"I WILL REMEMBER. WHEN I BECOME FOUNDATION-KEEPER... I WILL REMEMBER YOUR KINDNESS."***

---

### STONE PILGRIM STANDS (Non-hostile action)

**The Pilgrim rises to its full twenty-foot height.**

**It turns toward the northern wall of the chamber.**

**It raises all four arms.**

**And with deliberate, SLOW force—it begins carving a NEW TUNNEL through solid bedrock.**

***"I WILL EXIT HERE. YOUR RETURN-PATH REMAINS OPEN. GO SAFELY, SMALL-WITNESSES."***

**The sound is deafening—stone grinding, pillars singing in harmony, dust falling like rain.**

**It will take the Pilgrim approximately 10 minutes to carve through to a separate exit.**

---

## Resolution: The Aftermath

### No Combat Occurred

**ENCOUNTER RESOLVED PEACEFULLY.**

**The party watches as the Stone Pilgrim carves its exit tunnel.**

**Kessa (sheathing her sword):** *"Did we just... negotiate with a mountain?"*

**Elrik:** *"We negotiated with a PERSON. Who happens to be made of stone."*

**Nyra (rubbing her temples):** *"I can't believe that worked."*

**Roots:** *"Renewal teaches: All things transform. It sought transformation. We witnessed it. Balance is maintained."*

**After 10 minutes:**

**The Pilgrim breaks through the northern wall into a natural cave system. It steps through, then turns back one last time.**

***"MAY YOUR OWN PILGRIMAGES BE... WITNESSED WITH KINDNESS."***

**And it walks away, each footstep a small earthquake, fading into the deep stone.**

---

## Scene 2: Return to Surface

### The Choice

**The party is now alone in the Chamber of Choir Pillars.**

**Eleven pillars still glow softly (one remains dead). The seal is gone. The bound spirits are freed. The tremors have... stopped.**

**Elrik:** *"We need to get back to Stonebridge. Tell the Council what happened."*

**Kessa:** *"And warn every settlement north of here that a 20-foot stone pilgrim is coming."*

**Nyra:** *"The Trapped Below variant... we were supposed to be trapped. But the Pilgrim opened an exit.*"

**Roots:** *"Two paths now. The way we came—or the way the Pilgrim left."*

**OPTIONS:**

**A) Return via original shaft** - Climb 400 feet back up, face Captain Torvald and Council  
**B) Follow Pilgrim's tunnel** - Explore the cave system, potentially shorter route to surface  
**C) Rest here first** - The chamber is now safe, party is tired (Rest = ½ HD, ½ Resolve restoration)

---

### PARTY CHOOSES: Option C (Rest First)

**Elrik:** *"We burned resources getting down here. And we need to be coherent when we explain to the Council that we... released an ancient stone construct to wander the countryside."*

**Kessa:** *"Fair."*

**Nyra starts preparing ritual space for sleep.**

---

## Rest (Short Rest in Sacred Chamber)

**Location:** Chamber of Choir Pillars (now sacred but SAFE space)  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Restoration:** ½ HD (rounded up), +1 Resolve

**REST RESTORATION:**

**Nyra:**
- HD: 3d6 → **3d6 + [2]** = **5d6** (back to full!)
- Resolve: 5/5 → 5/5 (already full)

**Roots:**
- HD: 4d8 → **4d8 + [2]** = **6d8** (exceeds max of 5d8, stays at **5d8**)
- Resolve: 5/5 → 5/5 (already full)

**Kessa:**
- HD: 6d10 → **6d10 + [3]** = **9d10** (exceeds max of 6d10, stays at **6d10**)
- Resolve: 5/5 → 5/5 (already full)

**Elrik:**
- HD: 5d8 → **5d8 + [3]** = **8d8** (exceeds max of 5d8, stays at **5d8**)
- Resolve: 5/5 → 5/5 (already full)

**PARTY FULLY RESTORED (all back to max HD, all at full Resolve)**

**Note:** Because NO ONE took damage or spent Resolve during the encounter, Rest brought everyone back to maximum resources.

---

## Scene 3: The Return

### Climbing Back (400 feet)

**The party chooses the original shaft—they know the way, and Captain Torvald is waiting.**

**ATHLETICS CHECKS (Basic 2+)** - climbing 400 feet with ropes:

**Nyra:** 1d6 = **[5]** → Success  
**Roots:** 1d6 = **[3]** → Success  
**Kessa:** 1d6 = **[6]** → Success  
**Elrik:** 1d6 = **[4]** → Success

**ALL SUCCEED** - the climb takes ~30 minutes but is uneventful.

---

### Emerging at Twilight

> **You emerge from Shaft #7 as the sun sets. The western hills glow orange-red.**
>
> **Captain Torvald and a dozen militia guards are camped at the mine entrance. When your heads appear over the edge, weapons are drawn—then lowered in shock.**
>
> **Torvald:** ***"You're... alive?!"***

**The party climbs out, dusty and exhausted but unharmed.**

**Kessa (grinning):** *"Disappointed?"*

**Torvald:** *"The tremors stopped two hours ago. We thought... we thought the collapse took you. What happened down there?"*

**Nyra:** *"We need to speak to the full Council. Immediately."*

---

## Scene 4: The Council Convenes (Emergency Night Session)

### The Report

**The five Council members reconvene in the Town Hall. It's late—past midnight—but they come anyway.**

**The party stands before them, still covered in stone dust.**

**Priestess Kara:** *"Well? What did you find?"*

**Elrik (taking lead, scholar's precision):** *"The sealed chamber contained an entity called a Stone Pilgrim—a construct-spirit created by the followers of Khuldras 800 years ago. It was on a religious pilgrimage and was sealed for attempting the journey before it was deemed ready."*

**Durg (guilty):** *"We... freed it?"*

**Nyra:** *"It freed itself. The seal was designed to degrade after 800 years. You cracking it just accelerated the timeline."*

**Captain Torvald:** *"And WHERE IS IT NOW?!"*

**Kessa (blunt):** *"Walking north. Toward Khuldras' Spine. 400 miles away."*

**Chaos erupts.**

---

### Influence Check: Convincing the Council

**The party must convince the Council that:**
1. The Pilgrim is NOT a threat
2. It made an oath to avoid harming settlements
3. They need to warn northern towns, not muster an army

**PARTY APPROACH: Elrik presents evidence, Roots offers spiritual context, Nyra appeals to mercy, Kessa provides tactical assessment.**

**Combined Influence Check (Moderate 3+)** - each party member rolls, best result counts:

**Nyra:** 1d6 = **[2]**  
**Roots:** 1d6 = **[4]**  
**Kessa:** 1d6 = **[5]**  
**Elrik:** 1d6 + **2d6 (Scholar's Method - presenting evidence)** = **[3] + [6] + [4]** = **3 successes!**

**ELRIK'S SUCCESS** (3 successes on Moderate check - exceptional!)

**Elrik's presentation is MASTERFUL:**
- Shows the map route he drafted (avoiding major settlements)
- Explains the Pilgrim's oath and the cultural/religious significance of the journey
- Demonstrates that attacking it would be desecrating a sacred rite AND probably futile (it's 20 feet of living stone)
- Proposes sending messenger riders ahead to warn northern settlements

**Council Response:**

**Kara (thoughtful):** *"An oath sworn on the Foundation... that is sacred. Even I, who feared divine punishment, must acknowledge this."*

**Torvald:** *"I don't like it. But you're right—we can't fight it. And if it keeps its word..."*

**Mira:** *"My people need assurance. Can you GUARANTEE it won't destroy homes?"*

**Nyra:** *"We witnessed its oath. It made a promise. That's the best guarantee we can offer."*

**Harlan (calculating):** *"And the mine? The chamber?"*

**Roots:** *"The Choir Pillars remain. The ley-node is... quieter now. But stable. The tremors will not return."*

**Long silence.**

**Mira (swing vote):** *"I vote to send warning riders north and TRUST that these four did the right thing. They went where we couldn't. They deserve our faith."*

**COUNCIL VOTE: 3-2 to accept the party's solution.**

---

## Rewards & Outcomes

### Material Reward

**Harlan (grudgingly):** *"You didn't bring back treasure. But you ENDED the crisis. The mine is saved. Stonebridge survives."*

**Payment:**
- **300 gold upfront** (split 4 ways = 75g each)
- **No completion bonus** (didn't clear the chamber, but solved the problem differently)

**Supplies Granted:**
- Free lodging at the inn (1 week)

---

---

### Mechanical Testing Notes

**Peaceful Resolution Viability:**
- ✓ Level 1 party successfully negotiated with overwhelmingly powerful entity
- ✓ Investigation/Lore checks provided critical context (Pilgrim's purpose, oath culture)
- ✓ Influence checks created trust despite power imbalance
- ✓ No combat required—system supports non-violent solutions

**Affinity Dice in Non-Combat:**
- ✓ All 4 party members earned Affinity Dice through roleplay-aligned actions
- ✓ System rewards character-appropriate choices (mercy, transformation, freedom, knowledge)
- ✓ Non-combat encounters can be just as rewarding as combat

**Path Board Impact:**
- **Shadow-Trained (Nyra):** Didn't use stealth this session, but compassion/mercy drove decisions
- **Wild-Touched (Roots):** Spiritual communion was KEY to understanding Pilgrim's confusion
- **Unyielding (Kessa):** Resolve check advantage NOT tested (no Resolve checks occurred)
- **Scholar's Method (Elrik):** Maps and lore were CRITICAL to peaceful resolution

**Shaman Class Testing:**
- **Spiritual Guidance** detected bound spirits (key intel)
- **Voice of the Accord** allowed glyph-reading
- **Ancestral Blessing** attempted (failed, but narrative impact remained)
- Shaman's spiritual abilities were perfectly suited to this encounter

**Weaver Multi-Domain:**
- Nyra's Read the Weave revealed ley-node structure (crucial)
- Magical Armor on Kessa proved unnecessary (no combat) but demonstrated pre-combat prep
- Versatility allowed non-combat magical solutions

**Level 1 Limitations:**
- Low Proficiency (1d6) made Moderate checks DIFFICULT
- Party succeeded through TEAMWORK and PATH BONUSES (Scholar's Method +2d6 was clutch)
- Limited resources meant careful action economy decisions

---

### Variant Testing: Trapped Below

**How it was subverted:**
- The Pilgrim created an alternate exit (unplanned solution)
- Party chose to return via original shaft anyway (honor/closure)
- The "trap" became narrative tension, not mechanical punishment

**Cumulative Attrition:**
- Party entered Session 2 at 79% HD (19/24)
- Rested back to 100% during chamber rest
- Exited Session 2 at 100% HD (27/27 at Level 2)
- **No attrition** - peaceful resolution avoided damage

**This demonstrates:** Trapped Below variant creates *risk*, not guaranteed attrition. Smart play can avoid damage entirely.

### Session 3 Setup

**Party is now Level 2 in Stonebridge.**

**Immediate Hooks:**
1. **The Pilgrim's Journey** - Riders return with reports of sightings, reaction from northern towns
2. **The Chamber** - Eleven Choir Pillars remain; are they safe? Valuable? Study-worthy?
3. **Council Politics** - Harlan wants to mine deeper; Kara wants the chamber sanctified
4. **Reputation** - "The Witnesses" are now known; NPCs may seek their help

**Next Session Preview:**
Will the party:
- Track the Pilgrim's progress?
- Explore deeper depths beneath the chamber?
- Take on new contracts in Stonebridge?
- Travel north to ensure the Pilgrim keeps its oath?

**Expected Progression:**
- Level 3 after Session 5 (3 sessions away)
- More Path progression at Level 3 (Secondary Feat unlocked)

*"Four witnesses stood before living stone and chose understanding over violence. The Pilgrim walks north, seeking transformation. The bound spirits fly free. And in a small mining town, legends begin: of those who descended into darkness and emerged with mercy instead of gold."*
