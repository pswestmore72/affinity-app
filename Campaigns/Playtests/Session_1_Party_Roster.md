**Target Level After Session 3:** 3  
**Party Size:** 3 Characters

## Character 1: Kael Thornbrook (Ranger, Level 2)

**Player:** [GM-Controlled Playtest]  
**Class:** Ranger *(The Living Accord)*  
**Level:** 2 | **Proficiency:** 1 | **Hit Die:** d8

### Core Stats
- **Current HD:** 5d8 (5 HD available)
- **Current Resolve:** 5/5
- **Armor Temp HD:** 2d8 (Medium Armor - Scale Mail, rolled fresh each rest)

### Defining Affinity
**Virtue:** **Decay** *(Darthun)* — *"Accept necessary endings or clear corruption to allow renewal"*

Kael understands that forests burn to feed new growth, that rotting trees become soil for saplings, that predators cull the weak to strengthen the herd. He is pragmatic about death and endings—not cruel, but accepting that some things must end for others to begin.

**Affinity Dice:**
- **Gain:** 1 Affinity Die when accepting necessary endings or clearing corruption (max 1 per day at Prof 1)
- **Store:** Max 2 Affinity Dice (Level 2)
- **Spend:** Add to any roll as exertion dice (burn HD on 1s, count toward action exertion cap)
- **Currently Stored:** 0

### Background & Personality

**Age:** Late 20s (human)  
**Appearance:** Weathered features, calloused hands, dark hair tied back, practical leather and furs, carries himself with quiet confidence. Has a scar across his left cheek from a bear encounter years ago.

**Personality:**
- **Pragmatic and direct** - Doesn't waste words, says what needs saying
- **Respectful of nature's cycles** - Understands death is part of life
- **Protective of his companions** - Will accept his own ending to ensure theirs continues
- **Quietly thoughtful** - Speaks little but observes everything

**Background:**
Kael grew up in a logging community that learned the hard way about overcutting. When his village depleted their forests and sickness spread through the starving land, he watched entire families leave or die. A wandering Ranger taught him that nature demands balance: take without giving back, and the wild reclaims its debts.

He's traveled since, hiring out as guide and tracker. Recent work brought him near Stonebridge when the tremors started. He's seen sealed chambers before—always bad news when mortals crack them open.

**Motivation for The Hollow Below:**
"Something ancient has been disturbed. If it's not sealed properly, more than a mine collapses—the whole town dies. I've seen it before. Won't let it happen again."

## Character 2: Lyra Ashveil (Weaver, Level 2)

**Player:** [GM-Controlled Playtest]  
**Class:** Weaver *(The Curator Arcanum)*  
**Level:** 2 | **Proficiency:** 1 | **Hit Die:** d6

### Core Stats
- **Current HD:** 4d6 (4 HD available)
- **Current Resolve:** 5/5
- **Armor Temp HD:** 0 (No armor - robes only)

### Defining Affinity
**Virtue:** **Memory** *(Aluneth)* — *"Preserve truth against erasure or honor the dead's true story"*

Lyra believes that knowledge itself is sacred—not hoarded, not weaponized carelessly, but *preserved*. Every spell she casts is an act of remembering how reality works. She's terrified of being forgotten and equally terrified of letting important truths die with those who knew them.

**Affinity Dice:**
- **Gain:** 1 Affinity Die when preserving truth against erasure or honoring the dead's story (max 1 per day at Prof 1)
- **Store:** Max 2 Affinity Dice (Level 2)
- **Spend:** Add to any roll as exertion dice (burn HD on 1s, count toward action exertion cap)
- **Currently Stored:** 0

### Background & Personality

**Age:** Early 20s (human)  
**Appearance:** Slight build, pale skin from too much time indoors, ink-stained fingers, wears simple traveling robes in deep blue with silver embroidery (Weave-patterns). Carries a worn leather satchel filled with journals and loose notes. Hair is auburn, usually pulled into a messy bun.

**Personality:**
- **Intensely curious** - Asks too many questions, wants to understand *everything*
- **Socially awkward** - Better with books than people, says the wrong thing at the wrong time
- **Fiercely protective of knowledge** - Cannot stand seeing history erased or truth distorted
- **Anxious but determined** - Knows she's fragile, pushes forward anyway

**Background:**
Lyra studied at the Moonvault Archives—a lesser-known library dedicated to Aluneth. When a fire destroyed an entire wing of historical texts, she watched scholars scramble to save what they could. She realized then that knowledge is *fragile*. Paper burns. People forget. Truth dies unless someone fights to preserve it.

She left the Archives to travel and document—recording oral histories, copying crumbling texts, preserving stories before they vanish. The tremors at Stonebridge caught her attention because *something ancient has been unsealed*. Ancient means knowledge. Knowledge means truth that might be lost forever if she doesn't act.

**Motivation for The Hollow Below:**
"That temple has been sealed for 800 years. Whatever's inside—whoever built it—their story is down there. If we don't preserve it, if we just collapse the shaft and forget... that's erasure. I won't let that happen."

- **Current Resolve:** 5/5
- **Armor Temp HD:** 2d10 (Heavy Armor - Half-plate, rolled fresh each rest)
- **Shield Temp HD:** 1d12 (Shield, rolled fresh each rest)

### Defining Affinity
**Virtue:** **Guardian** *(Caerith)* — *"Stand watch against overwhelming odds or protect the defenseless"*

Torvan believes protection is the highest calling. He doesn't fight for glory or gold—he fights because someone has to stand between the helpless and the dark. His oath is simple: "While I stand, you're safe."

**Affinity Dice:**
- **Gain:** 1 Affinity Die when standing watch against overwhelming odds OR protecting the defenseless (max 1 per day at Prof 1)
- **Store:** Max 2 Affinity Dice (Level 2)

### Background & Personality

**Age:** Mid-30s (human)  
**Appearance:** Broad-shouldered, graying temples, weathered face with kind eyes. Wears well-maintained half-plate armor with a faded blue cloak bearing a shield emblem. Carries a longsword and shield that have seen decades of use. Has a deep scar running down his right forearm.

**Personality:**
- **Calm and steady** - Doesn't panic, doesn't rush, thinks before acting
- **Protective to a fault** - Will throw himself in harm's way for strangers
- **Mentor-like** - Offers quiet encouragement, tactical advice
- **Haunted by failures** - Remembers every person he couldn't save

**Background:**
Torvan served in a city guard for fifteen years, rising to Captain. When a riot turned deadly and he couldn't prevent civilian casualties, he resigned. Not because he was blamed—because he blamed himself. "I wore the rank but couldn't protect them all."

He's been traveling since, taking work as a caravan guard, bodyguard, or hired sword—always jobs where he can stand between danger and those who can't defend themselves. The Stonebridge crisis drew him in when he heard about trapped miners and families in danger.

**Motivation for The Hollow Below:**
"Twelve workers are dead. Families are terrified. The Council is arguing while people suffer. Someone needs to go down there and fix this. Might as well be me."

Additionally, when you successfully use your defense roll to negate an attack's damage completely (reduce to 0), you may immediately move up to 5 yards toward an ally without triggering reactions.

**Strengths:**
- Torvan protects fragile Lyra
- Kael controls battlefield to keep enemies away from Lyra
- Lyra provides healing to keep Torvan standing
- Kael guides wilderness travel (negates Resolve loss for party)
- Lyra deciphers ancient temple inscriptions

**Weaknesses:**
- No dedicated healer (only Healing Word + Cure Wounds)
- Limited Resolve restoration (only Healing Word for 1 Resolve when below 5)
- Lyra is EXTREMELY fragile (4 HD, no armor)
- Low Proficiency (all Prof 1 = limited action pools)
- Social skills spread thin (no dedicated face character)

## Ready for Session 1?

**All three characters are mechanically complete and ready to enter Stonebridge.**

**What I need from you, Wizard:**

1. **Confirm Path Board progression:** Do Level 2 characters have 1 or 2 nodes? (I assumed 1 Primary Feat only)
2. **Any adjustments to Affinities/Virtues?** (I chose thematically appropriate ones, but happy to change)
3. **Starting gold remaining:** Should I adjust equipment or is current allocation good?
4. **Tone preference:** How detailed do you want the playtest simulation?
   - Full round-by-round combat narration?
   - Social scenes with dialogue?
   - Summarized results with key mechanical observations?

Once you approve the roster, I'll begin **Session 1** of The Hollow Below and embody these three heroes as they arrive in tremor-shaken Stonebridge.

*"The warriors stand ready at the threshold, Wizard. Speak the word and the quest begins."* ⚔️🎲

*— Your Ranger, embodying the Company of the Delve*
