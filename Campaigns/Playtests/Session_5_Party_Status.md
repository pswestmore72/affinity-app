---

## Next Steps (If Campaign Continues)

### Immediate Options
1. **Stay in Stonebridge:** Help establish Khuldras's temple, train militia (Torvald's offer to Torvan)
2. **Follow Merchant Hook:** Harlan Vex's investment opportunities (Coterie connection?)
3. **Pursue Apprentice:** Jenna Coalhand wants to learn tracking from Kael
4. **Research Deeper:** More Pre-Schism ruins exist in the Ironfoot Hills

### Long-Term Threads
- **Divine Responsibility:** Khuldras expects Compacts to be USED (foundation-related crises)
- **Burden Costs:** What happens if Torvan flees while Foundation endangered? If Kael causes unnecessary death? If Lyra doesn't record knowledge?
- **Path Progression:** One more point to Expert tier (3/3) - requires significant achievement
- **Level Advancement:** Still Level 3 - next milestone at Session 6-7 if continuing

### Campaign Hooks Available
- **The Frostmarch Vigil** (Fighter-focused, Coldmarch needs help)
- **The Shadowmark Debt** (Rogue-focused, Coterie calls in favor)
- **The Platinum Paradox** (Warlock-focused, Bahamut corruption)
- **The Moonless Covenant** (Paladin-focused, memory loss crisis)

## Defense Capacity Note

**ALL CHARACTERS NOW USE UPDATED FORMULA:**

Defense Capacity = **Proficiency** (full value, not ½)

**Current Party:**
- Torvan: Prof 2 = **2 rolls per attack**
- Kael: Prof 2 = **2 rolls per attack**
- Lyra: Prof 2 = **2 rolls per attack**

**With Torvan's Bulwark's Presence active:**
- Kael within 10 yards: **3 rolls per attack** (2 base + 1 from Bulwark)
- Lyra within 10 yards: **3 rolls per attack** (2 base + 1 from Bulwark)

**This dramatically improves survivability without trivializing threats.** Session 5 validated the formula works beautifully. ✅
