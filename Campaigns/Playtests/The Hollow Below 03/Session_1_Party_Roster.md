## Player Character 1: Gareth Thornwood

**Class:** Sovereign (Level 3)  
**Ancestry:** Human  
**Background:** Sellsword turned philosopher  
**Affinity:** Obligation (The iron chains I forge for myself)

### Core Stats
- **Hit Dice:** 7d10 (Tough progression, current: 48 HD)
- **Proficiency:** 2 (Level 3)
- **Resolve:** 5/5
- **Affinity Dice:** 0/3 (max = Level, gain up to Prof/day)
- **Defense Dice:** 2d10 (Proficiency = 2)

### Resources & Economy
- **Centered Strike:** When at 0 Exertion, melee attacks deal +Prof (2) HD damage
- **Internal Alchemy:** (Prof times/rest = 2)
  - Convert 1 Resolve → restore Prof (2) HD
  - Convert Prof (2) HD → restore 1 Resolve
  - Spend 3 HD → gain 1 Exertion die this turn
- **Efficient Recovery:** Spend 1 Resolve → restore Prof (2) HD (once per short rest)

### Level 3 Abilities
- **Resource Cascade:** When you convert resources using Internal Alchemy, you may immediately convert again at half value (rounded down). Once per short rest.
  - *Example: 1 Resolve → 2 HD → 1 more HD (half of 2) = total 3 HD restored from 1 Resolve*
- **Deny Death:** When you would drop to 0 HD, immediately spend 2 Resolve to instead remain at Prof (2) HD. Once per long rest.

### Way: Way of the Undaunted (Level 2 Node)
**Philosophy:** "Pain is information. I choose what it tells me."

**Node 1 (Row 1):** *Controlled Collapse*
- When you fail a Resolve check, you may spend 1 Affinity die to treat the roll as if you rolled a 5 (hold Resolve). Once per short rest. Your collapse is deliberate, not desperate.

### Path Feats
**Level 1 Primary:** Unyielding (Resilience discipline)
- When at 0 Resolve, your first Resolve check each scene gains +1d6 (doesn't burn HD on 1s). Your lowest moment is where you find purchase.

**Level 3:** Second Wind
- Once per short rest when below half HD, use free action to restore Prof (2) HD. Your body remembers how to endure.

### Equipment
**Armor:** Chain shirt (Medium, 2d8 temp HD) + Shield (1d12 temp HD) = **3d8 + 1d12 defense layer**  
**Weapons:**
- Longsword (Heavy, 2 HD base damage, both hands)
- Hand axe (Light, 1 HD base, throwable 10/30 yards) ×2

**Adventuring Gear:**
- Backpack with 50 yards rope, grappling hook, bedroll
- Belt pouch with 80 gold
- Waterskin, trail rations (5 days)
- Whetstone, oil flask

### Combat Stats
- **Attack (Longsword, no exertion):** Basic (2+), 1 success required, 2 HD base damage
- **Attack (Longsword, 1 exertion die):** Advanced (3+), depends on successes, 2 HD + exertion successes
- **Defense:** 2d10 (Proficiency dice) + 3d8 (armor) + 1d12 (shield) = 2d10 + 3d8 + 1d12 total
- **At 0 Exertion:** Centered Strike adds +2 HD damage to melee attacks

### Personality
**Demeanor:** Calm, measured, never wastes movement or words  
**Philosophy:** "The only chains that matter are the ones I choose to carry."  
**Motivation:** Seeking purpose beyond selling violence—Chandle's offer of "meaningful work" intrigued him  
**Quirk:** Counts his breaths during stress (1 breath = 1 HD spent, tracking his internal economy physically)

## Player Character 2: Elara Voss

**Class:** Scholar (Level 3)

**Philosophy:** "Everything has a structure. Structure has rules. Rules can be exploited."

- **Spell Attack (Curator's Bolt):** Basic (2+), 1 success required, 1 HD force damage + scaling
- **Defense:** 2d8 (Proficiency) + 2d6 (studded leather) = 2d8 + 2d6 total
- **With Predictive Cognition:** 2d8 + 2d6 + 2d6 (once per rest)

### Personality
**Demeanor:** Curious, analytical, sees combat as data collection  
**Philosophy:** "Every battle is a pattern. Every pattern can be solved."  
**Motivation:** Investigating Stonebridge's quakes as potential Weave disturbance (Curator's Library sent her)  
**Quirk:** Mutters calculations aloud during combat ("70% probability of evasion, 30% armor absorption...")

**Philosophy:** "We survive together, or not at all."

## Party Dynamics

**Gareth + Elara:** Philosopher-warrior meets analytical scholar. Gareth appreciates Elara's pattern recognition; Elara finds Gareth's internal discipline fascinating ("You treat your body like a ledger").

**Gareth + Kara:** Mutual respect for discipline. Gareth's self-imposed chains vs Kara's oath-bound service. Both understand sacrifice.

**Elara + Kara:** Scholar meets priestess. Elara curious about divine magic vs arcane structures; Kara patient with questions, sees teaching as service.

**Party Composition:**
- **Tank/Resource Manager:** Gareth (7d10 HD, 3d8+1d12 armor, self-healing via Internal Alchemy)
- **Damage/Analysis:** Elara (Arcane spells, Analyze for tactical advantage, Expose Weakness combo)
- **Support/Healer:** Kara (Power Word: Endure for HD+Resolve restoration, Seal Minor Wound, defensive buffs)

**Tactical Synergy:**
- Elara Analyzes enemy → Expose Weakness + Tactical Projection → grants ally +1d6
- Gareth takes hits with heavy armor → uses Internal Alchemy to self-sustain → Centered Strike when low exertion
- Kara keeps party Resolve high (Power Word: Endure) → prevents collapse spiral
- Kara's Hearth-Keeper + healing spells grant bonus dice to actions → increases success rates
