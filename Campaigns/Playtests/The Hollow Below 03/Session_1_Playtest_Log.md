## Scene 1: The Dancing Mare — Chandle's Proposition

### Setting: Moonstone, Evening

The **Dancing Mare** is a two-story inn on Moonstone's eastern edge, where the merchant road curves toward the Ironpeaks. Lamplight spills through thick glass windows, and the scent of roasted mutton and ale drifts into the cool evening air. Inside, the common room buzzes with travelers: a trio of dwarven traders arguing over a contract, a human bard tuning a lute by the hearth, and scattered locals nursing their drinks.

At a corner table near the back, a figure sits alone.

**Chandle** is impossible to miss once you notice him. A **gnome** in his late sixties, barely four feet tall but radiating presence like a well-tailored coat. His clothing is immaculate: deep purple traveling robes embroidered with silver thread in geometric patterns (Weaver's marks, if you know how to read them), polished boots, and a wide-brimmed hat resting on the table beside a glass of wine. His beard is steel-gray, braided with tiny copper rings that clink softly when he moves. A carved wooden staff leans against the wall behind him, its head wrapped in cloth.

He's reading a leather-bound ledger, occasionally making notes with a charcoal pencil. A brass lockbox sits on the table in front of him, sealed with arcane glyphs that shimmer faintly—a merchant's portable vault.

The innkeeper, a heavyset woman named **Mira**, catches sight of the party as they enter and waves them toward Chandle's table. "You must be the ones he's been waiting for. Good luck—he's a particular sort."

---

### Chandle's Opening (Introductions)

As the party approaches, Chandle doesn't look up immediately. He finishes writing a line in his ledger, sets down the pencil with deliberate precision, and *then* raises his eyes to regard each of you in turn.

His gaze is sharp—evaluating, measuring, pricing. Not hostile, just... mercantile. Like you're goods he's considering purchasing.

"**Gareth Thornwood. Elara Voss. Kara Ironshod.**" He recites your names with perfect pronunciation, as if reading from his ledger even though he's closed it. "**Please, sit. I've taken the liberty of ordering dinner—roasted mutton with rosemary, fresh bread, and whatever you'd like to drink. It's on my coin.**"

He gestures to the three empty chairs across from him.

"**I am Chandle Brightscribe, merchant of the Reflected Realms, licensed Weaver in good standing with the Curator's Arcanum, and currently under contract with the Stonebridge Mining Consortium. I'm told you're capable individuals looking for work that involves more than hauling crates or guarding oxen.**"

He pours himself another glass of wine from a bottle on the table—expensive vintage, you'd guess from the label.

"**I need three things. Competence, discretion, and willingness to descend into places most sane people avoid. If you possess all three, I have a proposition that pays well and may save a town from collapsing into the earth. Interested?**"

He waits, watching your reactions.

*(GM Note: Chandle is Level 5 Weaver, Proficiency 3, highly intelligent and socially adept. He speaks like a contract negotiator—every word chosen deliberately. He's not warm, but he's fair.)*

---

### Party Responses (Roleplay Moment)

**Gareth Thornwood** (Sovereign 3, Obligation Affinity):
How does Gareth respond to Chandle's direct, transactional approach? Does he appreciate the lack of pretense, or does he probe for deeper motivations?

*Gareth sits slowly, placing his longsword against the table edge within reach (habitual caution, not hostility). His breathing is measured—one breath in, hold, one breath out. Counting his economy even here.*

**Possible response:** "You've done your research on us. Fair enough—I respect efficiency. But before we discuss terms, I'd like to know what 'places most sane people avoid' means in practical terms. I've sold my sword before, Chandle. I won't sell it blind."

*(Gareth's Philosophy: "The only chains that matter are the ones I choose to carry." He won't bind himself to unknown terms.)*

---

**Elara Voss** (Scholar 3, Memory Affinity):
How does Elara engage with Chandle? Does she recognize him as a Weaver (Level 5, higher than her spellcasting tier)? Does she ask about the Weave disturbances near Stonebridge?

*Elara's eyes flicker to the brass lockbox—arcane glyphs, Expert-tier ward work at minimum—then to Chandle's staff (wrapped head suggests powerful focus hidden). She pulls out her journal and opens it to a blank page, pencil ready.*

**Possible response:** "You're a Weaver. Level 5, judging by the warding complexity on your lockbox. That means you can handle Expert-tier threats without hiring sellswords." *(She taps her pencil against the page, calculating.)* "Which means whatever's in Stonebridge is either Legendary-tier dangerous, or it requires numbers you don't have, or it's outside your contracted obligations. Which is it?"

*(Elara's Philosophy: "Every battle is a pattern. Every pattern can be solved." She wants data before commitment.)*

---

**Kara Ironshod** (Priest 2, Communion Affinity):
How does Kara approach this? She's traveling to Stonebridge *anyway* to help rebuild—Chandle's offer may align with her existing purpose.

*Kara sets her shield against the table leg and sits with a dwarf's solid certainty. She signals Mira for ale, then regards Chandle with the same appraising eye she'd give a blade needing tempering.*

**Possible response:** "I'm heading to Stonebridge regardless—Murien's priests go where things need fixing. If your work aligns with that, we'll talk terms. If you're asking me to guard your coin while you profit from others' suffering, I'll eat your mutton and find my own way there."

*(Kara's Philosophy: "A well-made tool serves many hands." She won't be exploited, but she serves her community.)*

---

### Chandle's Response (After Party Answers)

Chandle listens to each response without interruption, nodding occasionally. When the party finishes, he sets down his wine glass and leans forward slightly.

"**Good. You ask the right questions. Let me answer them.**"

He pulls a folded map from his robes and spreads it on the table—Stonebridge and the surrounding Ironpeaks region.

"**First: what's happening. Stonebridge is a mining town, population eight hundred, built over an ancient sealed temple to Khuldras—Custodial Power of consequence and restraint. Eight hundred years ago, the temple was deliberately buried and warded to contain something dangerous. Three weeks ago, mining operations broke through an outer ward. Since then: earthquakes, tunnels collapsing, miners reporting voices, one shaft sealed after workers went missing.**"

He taps the map at Stonebridge's location.

"**The town council is divided. Half want to seal everything permanently and abandon those shafts. The other half want to investigate—worried that sealing it improperly will make things worse. I'm under contract to transport goods there, but I've been authorized by the 'investigate' faction to hire capable individuals to descend into Shaft #7 and assess the situation.**"

He looks directly at Elara.

"**You're correct—I'm Level 5 Weaver, Proficiency 3. I *could* handle Expert-tier threats. But this isn't about combat capability. It's about numbers and exploration. Temples don't have single guardians—they have layers. Traps, wards, corrupted constructs, unstable ley convergence. I need a team who can explore, survive, and report back. I'll provide support from the surface, but I won't risk my life for Stonebridge's problems when they have coin to hire others.**"

He looks at Kara.

"**As for profit from suffering: I'm being paid to transport goods. The investigation contract is separate—300 gold split among your team, plus one magic item from my stock as a bonus. If you're going to Stonebridge anyway, Priestess, this gives you resources to help rebuild *and* solves the root problem causing the damage. You're not guarding my coin—you're earning your own while serving your patron.**"

He looks at Gareth.

"**'Places most sane people avoid' means an 800-year-old temple to a god of consequence, buried deliberately, now disturbed. Expect magical defenses, constructs that don't age, and environmental hazards. The missing miners may be dead, corrupted, or trapped. You'll descend Shaft #7, reach the temple's outer structure, assess stability, and either disable the disturbance or report what's needed to seal it properly.**"

He folds his hands.

"**I'm offering fair pay for dangerous work with clear objectives. You're free to decline. But if you accept, I'll transport you to Stonebridge in my caravan—1.5-day journey instead of 3 on foot, inside a magically expanded wagon with heat, beds, and meals. We leave at dawn.**"

"**Questions?**"

---

### Party Discussion (Mechanical + Roleplay)

This is the negotiation/decision point. The party can:
1. **Accept immediately** (proceed to shopping scene)
2. **Negotiate terms** (Influence checks if trying to increase payment or add conditions)
3. **Ask more questions** (Lore checks about Khuldras, Weave disturbances, temple structure)
4. **Decline and find another route** (unlikely given Kara's existing motivation, but possible)

**Mechanical Options:**

**Elara's Lore Check (if she asks about Khuldras/temples):**
- **Scholar's Method** + **Polymathic Mind** = +2d6 to Lore checks (doesn't burn HD on 1s)
- **Lore Master (Ancient Civilizations)** = Requires 1 fewer success
- **Tier:** Basic (2+) normally, but with Lore Master becomes easier (auto-succeed with 0 successes if using Prof dice only)
- What would Elara ask?

**Gareth's Negotiation (if he pushes for better terms):**
- **Proficiency 2** dice for Influence check
- **Tier:** Depends on what he's asking (small increase = Basic 2+, major change = Advanced 3+)
- Chandle will counter-negotiate (Prof 3, +1d6 for merchant experience = 4d6 total)

**Kara's Assessment (if she wants to verify Chandle's intentions):**
- **Invoke Resilience** gives +1d6 to willpower/endurance checks (might apply to reading sincerity)
- **Awareness check** to gauge if Chandle is hiding anything: Basic (2+), 1 success required
- Chandle *is* being honest—he's a pragmatic merchant, not a villain

---

### What Actually Happens (GM Simulation)

Let me simulate the party's likely response based on their character profiles:

**Elara** (most likely to probe further):
"Tell me about Khuldras. Custodial Power of consequence and restraint—that's unusual phrasing. Most people call it judgment or karma. What was this temple's specific function?"

**Lore Check (Ancient Civilizations):**
- Base: Basic (2+), normally 1 success required
- **Lore Master:** Requires 1 fewer success (0 required with any success)
- **Scholar's Method + Polymathic Mind:** +2d6 (doesn't burn HD on 1s)
- **Proficiency 2** + 2d6 bonus = 4d6 total, rolling at threshold 2+ (need 0 successes due to Lore Master)

**Rolling:** [4d6]: 6 (explodes!), 3, 2, 5 → Reroll 6: 4 → **Total: 6, 3, 2, 5, 4 = 5 successes**

*(With Lore Master, this is massive over-success—Elara recalls extensive details)*

**Chandle's Response:**
He raises an eyebrow, impressed.

"**You know your history. Khuldras isn't widely worshiped—too abstract for most. The temple wasn't for worship. It was a prison-library. Khuldras's domain is consequence—actions have weight, debts must be paid, nothing is free. The temple stored... let's call them 'debts of the realm.' Magical contracts, curses, bound entities whose release would tip cosmic balance. Sealed eight centuries ago during the Fracture Wars when the Custodial Powers were reshuffling power.**"

"**If the wards are failing, it's not just 'angry spirits'—it's consequences trying to collect. That's why I need investigators, not warriors. You need to figure out *what* is trying to get out and whether it can be re-sealed.**"

---

**Gareth** (likely accepts terms but wants clarity):
"300 gold split three ways—100 each. Plus one magic item total, or one each?"

**Chandle:**
"**One magic item total, chosen from my traveling stock. I'll let you browse after we agree to terms. Most items are Common to Basic tier—I keep the Advanced+ stock in secure vaults. The item is a hiring bonus, not a completion reward. You get it regardless of outcome, assuming you attempt the job in good faith.**"

"**The 300 gold is paid upon return with your report. If you don't return, your next of kin receive 50 gold each as death benefit. I'm a licensed merchant—my contracts are bonded.**"

---

**Kara** (likely satisfied with alignment to Murien's purpose):
"Fixing broken wards and preventing collapse—that's honest work. I'm in. But if we find survivors down there, getting them out is part of the job. Not negotiable."

**Chandle:**
"**Agreed. Rescue survivors if possible. I'm not a monster, Priestess—I'm a merchant. Reputation matters. If you pull trapped miners out alive, the council will pay additional bounty that I'll ensure you receive.**"

---

### Agreement Reached

**Party accepts Chandle's terms:**
- 300 gold (100 each) upon return with report
- 1 magic item (chosen from Chandle's Basic-tier traveling stock)
- Transport to Stonebridge via magical caravan (1.5 days, includes meals/lodging)
- Rescue survivors if encountered
- Assess temple disturbance and report findings

**Chandle** produces a contract scroll (pre-written, professional).

"**Read it, sign it, or walk away. I don't do handshake deals—too many variables.**"

*(The contract matches his stated terms exactly. Elara's Comprehend Script spell could verify if she's paranoid, but it's unnecessary—Chandle's reputation as a fair dealer is genuine.)*

**Party signs.**

"**Done. Now, let's discuss my traveling stock. I assume you'd like to see what you're choosing from?**"

---

## Scene 2: Chandle's Traveling Stock (Shopping)

Chandle retrieves a second lockbox from beneath the table (smaller, different glyphs). He speaks a command word in Draconic (*"Volstrum kazdrit"*—"Inventory reveal"), and the lid opens.

Inside: six items, each wrapped in velvet cloth.

"**Choose one. The rest stay with me.**"

### Chandle's Traveling Stock (Basic-Tier Magic Items)

**1. Cloak of the Traveler** (Common+)
- Light cloak, deep blue with silver stitching
- **Effect:** Reduce travel-based Resolve loss by 1 (minimum 0). When worn during long journeys, you arrive less exhausted.
- **Narrative Benefit:** Always appear well-rested after travel, clothing resists dirt/wear
- *"For those who walk far and must arrive ready."*

**2. Dagger of Returning** (Basic)
- Balanced throwing dagger, rune-etched blade
- **Effect:** After throwing, use free action to speak command word (*"Kaelith"*—"Return"). Dagger teleports back to your hand. Unlimited uses.
- **Damage:** 1 HD (light weapon, throwable 10/30 yards, normal rules)
- *"You'll never lose this one."*

**3. Everburning Torch** (Common+)
- Iron torch with crystal core, never needs fuel
- **Effect:** Sheds bright light 30 yards, dim light 30 yards beyond. Cannot be extinguished by mundane means (water, wind). No heat (safe to carry).
- **Narrative Benefit:** Never worry about light sources in darkness
- *"Practical. Reliable. Boring. Exactly what you need in a dungeon."*

**4. Satchel of Holding** (Basic)
- Leather satchel, larger inside than outside (spatial folding)
- **Effect:** Holds up to 100 pounds of gear (weight reduced to 10 pounds when carried). Items retrieved as normal action.
- **Limit:** Cannot store living creatures, liquids must be in sealed containers
- *"Weaver standard kit. Don't put liquids in it."*

**5. Ring of Minor Warding** (Basic)
- Silver ring, inscribed with Arcane glyphs
- **Effect:** Once per short rest, when you would take damage, use a triggered action to activate the ring. Gain +1d12 bonus to your defense roll *for that single attack only* (rolled as d12, 5+ cancels damage). Describe the shimmer of arcane energy deflecting the blow.
- **Recharge:** Passive, resets after short rest
- *"Saved my life twice. Yours, maybe once."*

**6. Hearthstone** (Basic)
- Smooth river stone, warm to touch
- **Effect:** Once per long rest, place stone on ground and speak activation word (*"Varunath"*—"Sanctuary"). Creates 15-yard radius zone of warmth and comfort for 8 hours. Zone provides:
  - Comfortable temperature (negates cold environmental effects)
  - Faint light (dim illumination, 15 yards)
  - +1d6 to all Resolve checks made during rest within zone (emotional comfort)
- **Limit:** Zone is stationary; if you leave, effect continues but you lose benefits
- *"For when the wilds turn hostile and you need a bit of home."*

---

### Party Decision: Which Item to Choose?

**Mechanical Analysis:**

1. **Cloak of the Traveler** - Reduces travel Resolve loss (good for Rangers, but party has Chandle's caravan)
2. **Dagger of Returning** - Free-action retrieval, infinite throwing (solid combat utility for Gareth or Elara)
3. **Everburning Torch** - Infinite light (practical for dungeon delving, VERY useful given party has 1 lantern)
4. **Satchel of Holding** - 100 lb capacity at 10 lb weight (massive loot/supply carrying)
5. **Ring of Minor Warding** - +1d12 defense once per short rest (defensive safety net, best on frontline tank)
6. **Hearthstone** - Safe rest zone + Resolve check bonus (great for long expeditions)

**Likely Party Discussion:**

**Elara** (tactical mind): "We're going into a sealed temple with unknown hazards. I vote Everburning Torch—light is life in enclosed spaces, and we only have one lantern with 10 uses of oil."

**Gareth** (practical): "Ring of Minor Warding goes on whoever's taking hits—me or Kara. +1d12 once per rest could prevent a collapse spiral if we get overwhelmed."

**Kara** (preparedness): "Hearthstone. If we're down there for multiple days, having a safe rest zone with Resolve bonuses could mean the difference between holding together and falling apart. We can bring mundane torches."

**Chandle** (if asked for advice): "**If you plan to be down there more than a day, Hearthstone or Satchel. If you expect heavy combat, Ring. If you're worried about darkness, Torch. I'd personally take the Satchel—dead adventurers can't spend gold, and you'll need to haul loot out to fund your next expedition.**"

---

### Party's Actual Choice (GM Simulation)

Given party composition (no darkvision mentioned, dungeon environment, practical needs):

**After brief discussion, Elara makes the case:**

"We're Level 3 specialists going into an 800-year-old temple. We don't have darkvision. Kara's Oath Light spell lasts 10 minutes base—useful for camps, but not continuous exploration. My lantern has 10 hours of oil total. If we're down there for two days, we'll be rationing light and risking exhaustion penalties."

**Gareth nods:** "Darkness kills as surely as blades. Practical choice."

**Kara agrees:** "Murien teaches: 'Work in the light.' I'll support that."

**Party chooses: Everburning Torch**

**Chandle unwraps it and hands it to Gareth (default carrier, frontline position).**

"**Smart. Boring, but smart. Keep it lit at all times down there—if it goes out, something magical is interfering. That's your warning to run.**"

He re-seals the lockbox, storing the other five items.

"**Now. We leave at dawn. My caravan is parked at the eastern gate—you can't miss it. Oxen-drawn wagon, purple canvas with silver trim, larger inside than outside. Bring your gear. Any other questions before we part ways?**"

---

### Final Questions / Wrap Scene 1

**Does the party ask anything else before retiring for the night?**

Possible questions:
- "What's the caravan journey like?" (Chandle describes interior, meals, route)
- "Tell us about Stonebridge's council factions" (Political dynamics, who hired him)
- "What do you know about the missing miners?" (Durg Blackiron's daughter Jenna survived, others didn't)
- "Can we purchase additional supplies from you?" (Chandle sells standard gear at normal prices, no gouging)

**Assuming no critical questions:**

**Chandle:**
"**Get a good night's rest. We'll have 1.5 days to talk on the road—I'll answer your questions then. Breakfast is at dawn; we depart within the hour.**"

He stands, leaving coins on the table for the meal, and collects his lockboxes.

"**Until morning, then. Try not to die in your sleep—I've already filed the contract.**"

He exits the inn with a merchant's brisk efficiency, leaving the party to their dinner and preparations.

---

## End of Scene 1

**Party Status:**
- **Location:** Moonstone, Dancing Mare inn
- **Time:** Evening, retiring for the night
- **Contract:** Accepted (300g + Everburning Torch, investigate Shaft #7)
- **Transport:** Chandle's caravan departs at dawn
- **Resources:** All at full (HD, Resolve, Affinity at 0)

**Next Scene (Session 1 continues):**
- **Scene 2:** The Caravan Journey (1.5 days, roleplay + Chandle exposition)
- **Scene 3:** Arrival at Stonebridge (council meeting, faction dynamics)
- **Scene 4:** Investigation phase (interview Durg, survivors, town NPCs)
- **Scene 5:** Descent into Shaft #7 (dungeon entrance, initial exploration)

**Time Estimate:**
- Scene 1 (Chandle meeting): 30-45 minutes real-time
- Scene 2 (Journey): 20-30 minutes
- Scene 3 (Arrival): 30-40 minutes
- Scene 4 (Investigation): 45-60 minutes
- Scene 5 (Descent): 1+ hours (combat likely)

**Total Session 1 Length:** ~3-4 hours

---

## GM Notes (Mechanics Verification)

**Scene 1 had these rolls:**
1. **Elara's Lore Check** (Khuldras knowledge):
   - Base: Basic (2+), requires 1 success normally
   - **Lore Master:** Requires 0 success
   - **Scholar's Method + Polymathic Mind:** +2d6 (doesn't burn)
   - **Roll:** 4d6 → [6(exp→4), 3, 2, 5] = 5 successes
   - **Result:** Massive over-success, Chandle provides extensive temple history

**No combat this scene = no defense, exertion, or Resolve mechanics tested yet**

**Social mechanics functioned smoothly:**
- Chandle's negotiation was roleplay-driven, not contested rolls (party didn't push back on terms)
- Information gathering used Lore checks (passive knowledge system working well)
- Shopping was player choice (mechanical benefits understood, practical decision made)

**Pacing Notes:**
- Scene 1 runtime: ~800 words of GM narration + party responses
- Decision points: 3 (accept contract, choose item, final questions)
- Roleplay moments: Strong character voice establishment (Gareth's breath-counting, Elara's calculations, Kara's forge metaphors)

*The Paladin has chronicled Scene 1, Wizard. Three heroes meet a merchant, accept dangerous work, and prepare to descend into consequence itself. The tale begins.*

---

## Scene 2: The Caravan Journey — 1.5 Days to Stonebridge

### Setting: Moonstone Eastern Gate, Dawn

The party arrives at Moonstone's eastern gate as the sun breaches the horizon, painting the Ironpeaks golden. Chandle's caravan is exactly where he said it would be—and exactly as impossible as promised.

The **wagon** itself appears mundane from outside: 8 feet wide, 10 feet long, oxen-drawn, purple canvas stretched over wooden ribs. But the canvas *shimmers* subtly, like heat haze, and the spatial geometry doesn't quite resolve correctly if you stare too long. The wagon seems to occupy more space than it should, bleeding into reality's margins.

Two massive oxen stand patiently in harness—**constructs**, Elara realizes immediately. Their eyes glow faint amber, and their movements are too precise, too tireless. Chandle sits on the driver's bench, checking reins that control nothing (the oxen are magically commanded).

He waves the party over.

"**Good. You're punctual. Toss your gear inside—don't worry about space.**"

### Interior: Spatial Folding (The Weaver's Trick)

When Gareth pulls aside the canvas flap and steps inside, the impossible becomes everyday.

**Inside Dimensions: 30 feet × 30 feet**  
**Outside Dimensions: 8 feet × 10 feet**

The interior is a **traveling merchant's salon**:
- Plush rugs covering wooden floorboards (no rattling from wagon movement)
- Four hammocks suspended along the walls (sleeping quarters)
- Central table bolted to floor, covered in maps and ledgers
- Pot-belly stove in corner (magically fueled, warm but not hot)
- Storage chests along walls (locked, glyphed—Chandle's inventory)
- **Windows** that show outside views *despite being in the middle of a closed wagon* (spatial anchoring, looking out at the road)
- Shelves with traveling provisions: dried fruits, hard cheese, bread, waterskins, tea
- Lanterns hanging from ceiling (everburning crystals, soft warm light)

The floor is steady—no rocking, no jostling. The spatial fold dampens outside motion.

**Kara whistles low.** "You Weavers and your tricks. My master's forge had a spatial anvil once—20 pounds felt like 2. This is grander work."

**Chandle** (climbing inside, closing flap behind): "**Level 5 privilege. The fold costs 2 Resolve to anchor daily, but it's worth it. We'll cover 60 miles in 1.5 days without breaking stride. The constructs don't tire, the space provides comfort, and I can work while traveling.**" 

He moves to the central table, spreading a detailed map of the region.

"**Make yourselves comfortable. We have time to talk.**"

---

### The Journey Begins (Exposition & Character Moments)

The wagon lurches gently—barely perceptible inside the fold—and begins rolling east toward the Ironpeaks.

**Chandle** settles into a chair at the table, pouring himself tea from a ceramic pot. He offers cups to the party.

"**Since you're risking your lives for my contract, you deserve full context. I'll answer your questions, but let me start with what you *need* to know about Stonebridge.**"

He taps the map. Three locations marked in red ink:
1. **Stonebridge** (mining town, 800 population)
2. **Shaft #7** (eastern mining district, recently sealed)
3. **The Sealed Temple** (below Shaft #7, ancient Khuldras site)

---

### Chandle's Briefing (Key Information)

**"The Timeline:**
- **800 years ago:** Temple to Khuldras sealed deliberately during Fracture Wars. Buried under 200 feet of stone and warded by Custodial priests. Purpose: contain something dangerous—debts, contracts, bound entities tied to consequence. Temple becomes forgotten.

- **200 years ago:** Stonebridge founded by dwarven miners who discovered rich iron deposits. Town grows. Mining operations eventually dig deep enough to encounter outer temple structure, but ancient wards hold. Miners avoid that section—superstition and good sense.

- **3 weeks ago:** Mining crew led by **Durg Blackiron** (foreman, Proficiency 2, tough as bedrock) breaks through an outer ward in Shaft #7 while expanding operations. Immediate consequences:
  - Earthquake (magnitude 4, cracks foundations across town)
  - Miners report **voices** emanating from newly exposed chamber
  - Temperature drop in Shaft #7 (unnatural cold, 40 degrees)
  - One miner, **Kelvan**, walks into exposed chamber and doesn't return

- **2.5 weeks ago:** Durg leads rescue team of 4 miners into chamber. They find Kelvan's body—**mummified**, drained of all moisture, hands clutching a stone tablet with glowing glyphs. When they try to retrieve body, chamber activates: stone constructs emerge from walls. 
  - Combat ensues
  - 3 miners die (crushed, impaled, thrown into chasms)
  - Durg and his daughter **Jenna** escape, seal Shaft #7 with timber and stone
  - Jenna traumatized—won't speak about what she saw

- **2 weeks ago:** Town council emergency session. Two factions emerge:
  - **Seal It faction** (led by **Magistrate Harrow**, older human, cautious): Collapse Shaft #7 entirely, bury temple again, relocate mining operations, cut losses
  - **Investigate faction** (led by **Councilor Theren**, half-elf, pragmatic): Temple disturbance won't stop if ignored. Send expedition to assess threat, disable wards properly, prevent worse activation. Offer 300 gold bounty + support.

- **10 days ago:** Earthquakes continue sporadically (magnitude 2-3, every 2-3 days). Pattern suggests something beneath temple is *waking up*, trying to break free. Townsfolk increasingly nervous—some families evacuating.

- **5 days ago:** I arrive in Stonebridge with supply shipment. Councilor Theren hires me to find capable investigators. I agree—good coin, and I'm curious. I post notices in nearby towns, send word through contacts.

- **Yesterday:** You responded to my inquiry. Here we are.**"

Chandle sips his tea.

"**Questions?**"

---

### Party Questions & Lore Checks

This is an information-gathering scene. The party can ask Chandle anything about:
- Stonebridge's layout, key NPCs, resources
- Temple structure, Khuldras lore, expected threats
- Missing miners (who survived, who didn't, why)
- Council factions (politics, who to trust)
- What Chandle expects to find

**Likely Questions:**

**Elara** (most analytical): "You said 'debts of the realm'—magical contracts and bound entities. That's abstract. Give me concrete examples. What kind of consequences are we talking about? Cursed objects? Imprisoned demons? Reality anchors?"

**Lore Check (Khuldras Temple Function):**
- Already succeeded massively in Scene 1 (5 successes)
- Chandle provides follow-up details based on that success:

**Chandle:** "**Concrete examples from historical records—take this with archival salt, it's 800 years old:**
- **Debt Markers:** Physical tokens representing unpaid cosmic debts. Example: A king bargains with a devil for victory in war, pays half the price, flees the rest. The 'bill' is stored in Khuldras's temple as a stone tablet. If released, the debt *collects*—not just from the king, but his bloodline, his kingdom, anyone tied to the consequence.
- **Oath Anchors:** Binding contracts made with Custodial Powers. Example: A Weaver swears to never cast Ultimate-tier magic in exchange for knowledge. The oath is *locked* in the temple as a crystal shard. If shattered, the oath breaks—but so does the Weaver's connection to the Weave. The consequence manifests physically.
- **Consequence Embodiments:** Entities created purely from unresolved consequences. Example: A genocide ignored by the cosmos creates a 'Witness'—a creature that exists to enforce acknowledgment. It's imprisoned in the temple because releasing it would force *everyone* to confront the consequence, potentially triggering wars, collapses, mass Resolve loss.

The temple isn't storing *power*—it's storing *cause and effect that can't be allowed to resolve naturally without destroying the balance.*"**

He leans back.

"**So when I say 'something is trying to get out,' I mean: a consequence that's been delayed for 800 years is trying to collect. We need to figure out which one, how dangerous it is, and whether re-sealing is even possible.**"

**Gareth** (practical): "The stone constructs that killed the miners—what tier were they? What kind of threat are we walking into?"

**Chandle:** "**Durg described them as 'Awakened Wardens'—roughly humanoid, 7 feet tall, stone carapace with glowing veins. They moved with purpose, not randomness. Durg's Proficiency 2, and he said his pickaxe strikes barely scratched them. His miners had Prof 0-1, standard laborers.**

**Conservative estimate: Basic-tier constructs, maybe 20-30 HD each, stone resistance to physical damage. They likely regenerate while connected to temple ley lines—Durg said one he 'killed' started pulling itself back together.**

**BUT**—and this matters—those were *outer guardians*, defending the antechamber. Whatever's deeper in the temple will be worse. Expert-tier threats minimum, possibly Legendary if you reach the inner sanctum.**"

He looks at Gareth seriously.

"**You're Level 3. You can handle Basic-tier swarms if you're smart. Advanced-tier with preparation. Expert-tier is where you'll need every advantage, perfect tactics, and luck. Don't go deeper than you can handle—this isn't a 'clear the dungeon' job. It's 'assess and report.'**"

---

**Kara** (concerned with survivors): "You said Jenna survived but won't talk. Trauma or magical compulsion?"

**Chandle:** "**Durg thinks trauma—she watched three men she knew die horribly. But I'd verify. If she was *marked* by something in the temple, that's information you need. Murien's priestesses know trauma from curses, yes?**"

**Kara nods:** "I can tell the difference. If she's cursed, I'll see it. If she's just broken, I'll try to help."

**Chandle:** "**Good. Interview her when we arrive—Durg's protective, but he'll let you talk to her if you're respectful. She's maybe 20 years old, works as a hauler in the mines. Tough kid, but everyone has limits.**"

---

### Character Development Moments (Downtime Roleplay)

The wagon rolls onward. Hours pass. Chandle excuses himself to "check the constructs" (really giving the party privacy).

**1.5 days is two long rests + travel time.** This is a chance for character moments.

---

**Gareth's Moment (Evening, Day 1):**

Gareth sits on the floor near the stove, cross-legged, eyes closed. He's not sleeping—he's *counting*.

One breath in (hold). One breath out.  
One exertion die spent = one breath cycle.  
His internal economy, mapped to something physical.

**Kara** (watching from her hammock): "You do that a lot. The breathing thing. Training exercise?"

**Gareth** (eyes still closed): "Awareness exercise. My body has an economy—Hit Dice spent, Resolve lost, Exertion burned. If I lose track, I make bad trades. So I count. Every breath reminds me what I've spent, what I have left."

He opens his eyes.

"When I was a sellsword, I'd wake up after battles with no idea how I survived. Just... adrenaline, instinct, violence. Then I'd collapse for days. I was spending resources I didn't know I had."

He stands, rolling his shoulders.

"Now I *choose* what I spend. I know the cost before I pay it. That's the difference between being a weapon someone else swings and being a weapon I control."

**Kara:** "Murien teaches something similar. 'You can't forge what you don't measure.' Sounds like you've built a good discipline."

**Gareth:** (small smile) "Still works in progress. But I'm getting there."

*(Character beat: Gareth's Obligation Affinity = "The chains I forge for myself" is deliberate self-discipline, not external control)*

---

**Elara's Moment (Morning, Day 2):**

Elara has spread Chandle's maps across the table, cross-referencing them with her journal. She's sketching something—a diagram of the temple structure based on Chandle's descriptions.

**Chandle** (returning from outside): "You're mapping something that's 800 years old with 10 minutes of hearsay. Bold."

**Elara** (not looking up): "Patterns persist. Ancient temples follow architectural logic—concentric circles, cardinal alignment, hierarchical access. Khuldras is a Custodial Power of consequence and restraint. That means: checks and balances, layers, progressive revelation. The temple won't be random."

She taps her sketch.

"Outer chamber: Basic-tier guardians, public access for minor debts. Middle ring: Advanced-tier defenses, restricted to priests. Inner sanctum: Expert+ tier, containing the most dangerous consequences. Each layer requires escalating proof of worthiness or clearance."

**Chandle:** "And if you're clever enough to map it beforehand?"

**Elara:** "Then I know where the traps are, where the guardians will be thickest, and where the real danger sits. Knowledge lowers risk."

**Chandle** (impressed): "You'd make a good Weaver."

**Elara:** "I'm already a good Scholar. That's better."

*(Character beat: Elara's Memory Affinity = she's cataloging everything, building predictive models before entering danger)*

---

**Kara's Moment (Afternoon, Day 2):**

Kara sits at the stove, heating a small hammer over the flames. She's not forging—she's *blessing* the tool, murmuring prayers to Murien.

**Gareth:** "Ritual?"

**Kara:** "Maintenance. Murien teaches that tools carry memory—every strike, every repair. If you honor them, they serve better. I'm just... reminding my hammer what it's for."

She pulls it from heat, inspecting the head carefully.

"Craft is service. Service is community. Community is survival. When we go down into that temple, we're not just fighting constructs—we're fixing what's broken. Restoring balance. That's sacred work, even if it's dirty."

She sets the hammer aside, cooling.

"My master always said: 'You can tell a smith's worth by how they treat damaged tools.' The miners in Stonebridge are damaged tools right now. Broken by fear, loss, trauma. If we fix the temple, we fix them too."

**Gareth:** "That's... a kind perspective."

**Kara:** "It's practical. Broken communities don't pay bounties or rebuild. Fixed ones do. Murien's wisdom is 70% altruism, 30% economics."

*(Character beat: Kara's Communion Affinity = she sees helping the miners as restoring community bonds, which benefits everyone)*

---

### Arrival at Stonebridge (Late Afternoon, Day 2)

The wagon crests a hill, and **Stonebridge** comes into view.

**Setting Description:**

The town sits in a valley between two ridges of the Ironpeaks, bisected by the **Cold River** (a swift, clear stream fed by mountain snowmelt). A stone bridge (the town's namesake) spans the river, connecting the residential district (west bank) with the mining district (east bank).

**Population:** ~800 (70% dwarf, 20% human, 10% mixed ancestry)

**Key Landmarks (visible from approach):**
1. **Town Hall** (west bank, stone building with council chambers, Magistrate Harrow's office)
2. **The Bellows & Mug** (west bank, main tavern/inn, gathering place)
3. **Mining Operations HQ** (east bank, administrative building, foreman offices—Durg works here)
4. **Shaft #7** (eastern mining district, sealed with timber barricades, guards posted)
5. **Temple of Murien** (west bank, stone workshop-temple hybrid, run by **Sister Marla**, elderly dwarf priestess)
6. **Residential blocks** (mix of stone houses, worker barracks, merchants)

**Current Conditions:**
- Several buildings show **earthquake damage**: cracked foundations, collapsed chimneys, broken windows
- Repair teams working on scaffolding (wood, stone, ropes)
- Town is tense—you can see it in how people move (quick, wary glances, fewer children playing in streets)
- Mining district has **reduced activity**: only 3 of 7 shafts operational (the others sealed "pending safety review")

**The wagon rolls down the hill toward Stonebridge's main gate.**

Chandle pulls the constructs to a halt outside the gate. Town guards (2 dwarves in leather armor, holding spears) approach.

**Guard 1:** "Chandle Brightscribe. You're expected. Councilor Theren wants to see you—and these must be the investigators?"

**Chandle:** "They are. Where's the council meeting?"

**Guard 2:** "Town Hall, council chambers. Harrow and Theren are already arguing—you'll fit right in."

The guards wave them through.

---

### Chandle's Final Briefing (Before Council)

As the wagon parks near Town Hall, Chandle addresses the party one last time.

"**Here's the situation: You'll meet the council. Harrow will try to discourage you—he genuinely believes sealing is safer. Theren will brief you on the investigation—he's pragmatic but under pressure from frightened townsfolk.**

**Your job:**
1. Listen to both sides (gather information, assess political situation)
2. Interview survivors (Durg, Jenna, anyone else with first-hand knowledge)
3. Decide when you're ready to descend
4. Report findings to me or the council when you return

**Resources available:**
- Town will provide basic supplies (torches, rope, rations) at no cost
- Sister Marla (Murien's temple) can bless equipment or provide minor healing
- Durg can sketch rough map of Shaft #7 upper sections
- I'll remain in town at the Bellows & Mug—if you need arcane support *before* descent, find me

**Payment timing:** 300 gold when you return with report, regardless of what you find. Dead men don't spend coin, so don't die.**"

He stands, opening the wagon flap.

"**Ready to meet the council?**"

---

---

*The Paladin has chronicled the journey, Wizard. Your heroes have crossed the distance between doubt and duty. Stonebridge awaits—a town balanced on the edge of collapse, both literal and spiritual.*

---

## Scene 3: Town Hall — The Divided Council

### Setting: Stonebridge Town Hall, Council Chambers

The **Town Hall** is a squat, two-story stone building with reinforced walls—built to withstand both time and the occasional angry mob. Recent earthquake damage is visible: a crack running up the eastern wall, patched with mortar but still ominous.

Inside, the **council chambers** are a circular room with a raised dais where five council seats sit (currently only two occupied). Stone pillars support a domed ceiling, and narrow windows let in late afternoon light. The floor is polished granite, worn smooth by decades of boots.

**Present:**
- **Magistrate Harrow** (human, ~55, gray hair pulled back, stern expression, formal robes) - Seal It faction leader
- **Councilor Theren** (half-elf, ~40, sharp features, practical leather coat over tunic) - Investigate faction leader
- **6 townsfolk** sitting in gallery seats (miners, shopkeepers, concerned citizens observing)
- **Chandle** (entering with party)

As the party enters, Harrow and Theren are mid-argument.

**Harrow** (voice raised): "—and I'm telling you, sending *outsiders* into that shaft is gambling with lives we can't afford to lose! We seal it properly, relocate operations, and move on!"

**Theren** (calm, measured): "And I'm telling *you*, Magistrate, that burying our heads in rubble won't stop the earthquakes. Something is *waking up* down there. Sealing the entrance is like boarding up a door while your house burns."

They both turn as Chandle clears his throat.

**Chandle:** "**Magistrate Harrow. Councilor Theren. I present the investigators I was contracted to hire: Gareth Thornwood, Elara Voss, and Kara Ironshod.**"

He gestures to each party member in turn.

"**They've agreed to descend Shaft #7, assess the temple disturbance, and report findings. Per our contract, the Investigate faction has authorized 300 gold compensation plus support from town resources.**"

---

### Magistrate Harrow's Objection (Roleplay + Possible Conflict)

**Harrow** steps down from the dais, approaching the party. He's not hostile—he's *worried*. His eyes are lined with stress, and his hands tremble slightly (too many sleepless nights).

"**Three people.** You expect *three* people to succeed where Durg Blackiron failed? A trained foreman with Proficiency 2, four experienced miners, and they barely escaped with two survivors?"

He looks directly at Gareth.

"**What's your qualification, sellsword? You carry a longsword like you know how to use it, but can you fight stone constructs that regenerate? Can you navigate ancient wards without triggering catastrophic failure?**"

Then to Elara:

"**And you, scholar—what use is book-learning against things that have been sealed for 800 years? Do you have spells powerful enough to disable guardians? Can you even survive combat?**"

Finally to Kara:

"**A priestess of Murien. Craft and community. Admirable. But this isn't a forge that needs repairing—it's a tomb that should stay sealed. Your goddess teaches restraint, does she not? Knowing when to *stop* working rather than push forward?**"

He crosses his arms.

"**I'm not questioning your courage. I'm questioning whether Councilor Theren has sent you to your deaths to satisfy his curiosity.**"

*(GM Note: Harrow isn't a villain—he's genuinely trying to protect people. He's seen too much loss already.)*

---

### Party Response Options

This is a social/diplomatic challenge. The party can respond several ways:

**Option 1: Demonstrate Confidence (Influence Check)**
- Convince Harrow they're competent professionals, not reckless adventurers
- Base: Advanced (3+), 2 successes required (Harrow is skeptical but not hostile)
- Possible approaches: cite experience, explain tactics, display magical ability

**Option 2: Acknowledge Risk, Deflect to Theren**
- "We understand your concern, Magistrate, but the decision has been made. We'll proceed carefully."
- No roll required, avoids conflict but doesn't sway Harrow

**Option 3: Appeal to His Fear (Turn His Argument)**
- "You're right that sealing might fail. That's exactly why we need to know what's down there."
- Influence check, Advanced (3+), 2 successes required, on success Harrow grudgingly accepts

**Likely Party Response:**

**Elara** (most equipped for social combat with Scholar's precision):

"Magistrate, you're making assumptions based on incomplete data. Durg's team failed because they were unprepared—they were miners, not investigators. They encountered guardians by accident, with no reconnaissance, no tactical planning, no magical support."

She pulls out her journal, showing the temple map she sketched during travel.

"We've spent two days studying temple architecture, Custodial Power doctrine, and historical precedent. We know what to expect. We won't charge blindly into chambers—we'll map, assess, and retreat if necessary. Your concern is valid, but directing it at our competence is misplaced."

**Influence Check (Convince Harrow of Competence):**
- **Tier:** Advanced (3+), requires 2 successes
- **Elara's bonuses:** None directly applicable (Scholar's Method applies to Lore, not Influence)
- **Proficiency:** 2d8 (dice pool)
- **Approach:** Logical argument, demonstrating preparation

**Rolling:** [2d8]: 8 (explodes!), 4 → Reroll 8: 3 → **Total results: 8, 4, 3** → Checking thresholds (5+): **8=yes, 4=no, 3=no** → **1 success**

*(One short! Elara's logic is sound but doesn't fully overcome Harrow's emotional resistance)*

---

**Harrow** (shaking his head): "Preparation is good. But preparation doesn't guarantee survival. I've seen too many capable people die to things they thought they understood."

He sighs heavily.

"But... you're right that you're not *miners*. Maybe that's the difference."

He looks at Theren.

"I maintain my objection. But the vote has been cast. If they want to descend, I won't stop them."

---

### Councilor Theren's Briefing (Quest Details)

**Theren** steps forward, offering handshake to each party member (firm, professional).

"**Thank you for coming. Ignore Harrow's pessimism—he means well, but fear makes poor policy. Here's what you need to know:**"

He pulls a rolled parchment from his coat—a *contract*, official council seal at bottom.

"**Your objective: Descend Shaft #7, reach the temple's outer structure, assess the nature of the disturbance, and determine whether re-sealing is feasible. Specifically, we need to know:**
1. What type of entities/constructs are active?
2. Are the wards failing progressively or catastrophically?
3. Can they be reinforced, or must the temple be permanently collapsed?
4. Are there survivors (missing miner Kelvan, anyone else trapped)?

**Rules of engagement:**
- Do NOT attempt to fully clear the temple—this is reconnaissance, not conquest
- If you encounter threats beyond your capability, retreat and report
- Rescue survivors if possible, but prioritize your own survival
- Report findings to myself or Chandle within 48 hours of descent

**Compensation:**
- 300 gold, split as you see fit
- Town provides supplies: 20 torches, 100 yards rope, 7 days rations, 2 healing poultices (restore 2d6 HD each)
- Access to Sister Marla (blessings, healing, guidance)
- Durg Blackiron will brief you on Shaft #7 layout

**Timing:** Descend when ready. I recommend tomorrow morning—gives you time to prepare, interview survivors, rest.**"

He offers the parchment.

"**Sign here if you accept the terms.**"

---

### Party Decision Point

**Does the party sign immediately, or negotiate/ask questions first?**

**Gareth** (reading contract carefully—Obligation Affinity, he won't sign blind):

"Everything matches what Chandle told us. One addition: 'rescue survivors if possible' now includes Kelvan specifically. He's been missing three weeks—Magistrate, do you actually expect him alive?"

**Harrow** (grimly): "No. His body was mummified when Durg found it. But if his corpse can provide information about what killed him, bring it back. His wife deserves closure."

**Gareth** nods, signs.

**Elara** (signs without hesitation): "Terms are fair. One question, Councilor—has anyone attempted magical analysis of the disturbance? Weave readings, ley line surveys?"

**Theren:** "Chandle performed basic scans from surface level. He detected significant Weave instability below Shaft #7—equivalent to 'Expert-tier or higher' magical activity. But spatial interference prevented detailed readings. That's part of why we need ground-level investigation."

**Elara:** "Understood."

**Kara** (signs, then asks): "The healing poultices—who made them? I'd like to verify quality before we rely on them underground."

**Theren:** "Sister Marla crafted them. Murien's work, same as yours. You can inspect them when you visit her temple."

**Kara:** "Good. Then we have accord."

---

### Contract Signed — Quest Officially Accepted

**Theren** rolls the parchment, satisfied.

"**Excellent. Durg Blackiron is at the Mining Operations HQ across the bridge—he's expecting you. He'll brief you on Shaft #7's physical layout and answer questions about what his team encountered. His daughter Jenna is there as well, though... she may not be willing to talk.**"

**Harrow** (reluctantly): "If you're set on this, then go prepared. Sister Marla's temple is two blocks west—she can bless your weapons or provide guidance. The Bellows & Mug has rooms if you need lodging tonight."

**Theren:** "One more thing—"

He pulls a brass key from his pocket.

"**This opens Shaft #7's barricade. The guards know you're authorized. When you're ready to descend, show them this key and they'll clear the way.**"

He hands it to Gareth.

"**May the Custodial Powers watch over you. Stonebridge's survival may depend on what you find.**"

---

### Gallery Reaction (Townsfolk Observing)

As the party turns to leave, one of the townsfolk in gallery—a **human woman, ~30, miner's wife**—stands.

"**My husband is part of the crew that sealed Shaft #7. He... he hears the voices in his sleep now. Comes home shaking, won't go back below ground. If you can stop whatever's causing this, please... we need our mine back. We need our lives back.**"

Others murmur agreement.

**Kara** (turning to her): "What's your name?"

**Woman:** "Lira. My husband's name is Torvin."

**Kara:** "Lira, when we return, I'll speak to Torvin myself. Murien teaches that tools can be mended—so can people. I'll help if I can."

**Lira** (tears welling): "Thank you."

*(Social moment: Kara's Communion Affinity—she sees fixing the community as part of the job, not separate from it)*

---

## Scene 3 Transition: Next Steps

**The party exits Town Hall into late afternoon light (sun 2 hours from setting).**

**Chandle** (walking with them): "**You handled that well. Harrow's fear is infectious—if you'd been defensive, he'd have poisoned the townsfolk against you. Instead, Elara gave logical confidence, Kara gave emotional reassurance. Good work.**"

He gestures to three locations:

"**Your options for rest of today:**
1. **Mining HQ** (east across bridge) - Interview Durg and Jenna, get Shaft #7 layout
2. **Temple of Murien** (west, 2 blocks) - Sister Marla's blessings, inspect healing poultices, guidance
3. **The Bellows & Mug** (south, main tavern) - Lodging, food, gather rumors from locals

**I'll be at the Bellows & Mug. Find me if you need magical consultation before descent.**"

**Recommended order:** Interview Durg first (tactical information), visit Sister Marla second (blessings/healing), rest at tavern (prepare mentally), descend tomorrow morning.

**Time available:** ~4 hours until full dark, ~12 hours until recommended descent time (dawn)

---

### Party's Choice (Investigation Phase Begins)

**Where does the party go first?**

**Likely choice: Mining HQ (Durg interview)** — Most critical tactical information

**Gareth:** "We interview Durg now, while daylight holds. Get the map, understand what his team saw. Then Sister Marla before dark. Sleep at the tavern, descend at dawn."

**Elara:** "Agreed. Durg's first-hand account is more valuable than secondhand rumors."

**Kara:** "And I want to assess Jenna. If she's cursed rather than traumatized, we need to know before we go down there."

**Party heads east across the stone bridge toward Mining HQ.**

---

## End of Scene 3

**Party Status:**
- **Location:** Crossing bridge to east bank, heading to Mining HQ
- **Time:** Late afternoon (~4 PM, 2 hours until sunset)
- **Resources:** All at full (48/48 HD Gareth, 34/34 Elara, 28/28 Kara, all 5/5 Resolve)
- **Quest Items:** Brass key (Shaft #7 barricade access), signed contract (300g bounty)
- **Supplies Gained:** 20 torches, 100 yards rope, 7 days rations, 2 healing poultices (2d6 HD each) - *to be picked up from Town Hall stores before descent*

**Information Gained:**
- Council division confirmed (Harrow = fearful but not malicious, Theren = pragmatic leader)
- Townsfolk are desperate and traumatized
- Kelvan confirmed dead (mummified), body retrieval secondary objective
- Chandle confirmed Weave instability readings (Expert+ tier activity below)
- Sister Marla available for blessings/healing
- Durg waiting to brief on Shaft #7 layout

**Social Outcomes:**
- Elara's Influence check: 1 success (not enough to fully convince Harrow, but demonstrated competence)
- Kara created positive rapport with Lira (community building)
- Party signed official contract (quest formalized)

---

## GM Notes (Scene 3 Mechanics)

**Rolls Made:**
1. **Elara's Influence Check** (convince Harrow of competence):
   - Tier: Advanced (3+), required 2 successes
   - Pool: 2d8 (Proficiency 2)
   - Result: [8(exp→3), 4] → 1 success at threshold 5+
   - **Outcome:** Partial success—Harrow grudgingly accepts but remains worried

**Mechanics Tested:**
- Social skill check (Influence) functioned smoothly
- Threshold system worked (Advanced = 3+ needed 2 successes)
- Explosive dice triggered correctly (8 exploded to 3)

**No combat this scene** (council meeting, social/political drama)

**Next Scene Preview (Scene 4 - Durg Interview):**
- Mining Operations HQ interior
- Durg Blackiron (dwarf foreman, Proficiency 2, protective father)
- Jenna (traumatized survivor, won't speak easily)
- Shaft #7 layout map (rough sketch showing antechamber, guardian positions)
- Possible Awareness check to assess if Jenna is cursed vs traumatized
- Tactical information about construct behavior, ley line regeneration

**Estimated Scene 4 Length:** 30-40 minutes real-time

---

*The Paladin has chronicled the council's division, Wizard. Your heroes have passed the first social test—Harrow's fear did not break their resolve, and Theren's pragmatism has given them clear purpose.*

---

## Scene 4: Mining Operations HQ — Durg's Account

### Setting: East Bank, Mining District

The **stone bridge** arches over the Cold River—15 yards wide, carved from single granite slabs centuries ago. The water below rushes fast and clear, fed by mountain snowmelt. On the far bank, the mining district stretches east: administrative buildings, equipment storage, eight mine shaft entrances dotting the hillside.

**Mining Operations HQ** is a two-story stone building, functional rather than beautiful. Smoke rises from a chimney (interior heated by coal braziers). Outside, miners in work clothes move equipment, repair carts, and speak in low voices. The atmosphere is tense—these are people who've seen colleagues die and don't know if the danger is past.

Two guards (dwarves, leather armor, pickaxes instead of spears—miners pressed into guard duty) stand outside the main entrance. They nod as the party approaches.

**Guard:** "You're the investigators? Durg's inside. Office on second floor. Fair warning—he's not in a talking mood, but Theren ordered him to cooperate."

---

### Interior: Durg's Office

The second floor is a corridor of small offices—foremen records, scheduling ledgers, safety reports. At the end, a door marked **"D. BLACKIRON - FOREMAN - SHAFT #7"** stands slightly ajar.

Inside: a cramped office with walls covered in mine maps, gear inventories, and safety violation notices. A heavy wooden desk dominates the room, covered in half-written reports. Behind it sits **Durg Blackiron**.

**Durg Blackiron (Dwarf, Foreman, Proficiency 2):**
- Age: ~60, weathered face with deep lines from decades underground
- Build: Stocky, muscular, hands scarred from pickaxe work
- Clothing: Practical work trousers, leather vest, boots caked with stone dust
- Demeanor: Gruff, tired, carrying heavy guilt (lost three men under his command)
- Voice: Deep, gravelly, accent thick with dwarven inflection

He looks up as the party enters. His eyes are bloodshot—too much whiskey, not enough sleep.

"**You'd be the ones Theren hired. Sit, if you've got questions. Make 'em quick—I've got incident reports to file with families who'll never read 'em.**"

He gestures to three stools across from his desk.

Beside him, sitting on a bench against the wall, is **Jenna Blackiron**.

**Jenna Blackiron (Dwarf, Miner/Hauler, Proficiency 1):**
- Age: ~22, Durg's daughter
- Build: Lean, wiry, stronger than she looks
- Clothing: Work tunic, leather gloves, hair tied back
- Demeanor: **Traumatized**—stares at the floor, hands trembling slightly, doesn't make eye contact
- Voice: When she speaks (rarely), it's barely above whisper

She doesn't acknowledge the party's entrance. Her gaze is fixed on her boots.

---

### Durg's Initial Briefing (Tactical Information)

**Gareth** (sitting, direct): "We need to know what you saw down there. Formation, tactics, how the constructs fought, where they came from. Everything."

**Durg** (nodding approvingly—he respects directness):

"**Right to it. Good. Here's the chain of events:**"

He pulls a charcoal sketch from desk drawer—rough map of **Shaft #7 and the Antechamber**.

---

### Shaft #7 Layout (Durg's Map)

**The Sketch shows:**

**1. Shaft #7 Entrance (Surface Level):**
- Timber-reinforced vertical shaft descending 200 feet
- Wooden lift platform (pulley system, can carry 6 people + equipment)
- Currently **barricaded** at surface (timber planks, stone rubble, 2 guards posted)

**2. Main Tunnel (200 feet below surface):**
- Horizontal tunnel extending east 150 yards
- Standard mining construction: timber support beams every 10 yards
- Iron rail tracks for ore carts (currently empty, unused)
- Side tunnels branch north/south (older excavations, exhausted veins—sealed)

**3. "The Break-Through" (150 yards east of shaft bottom):**
- Where miners broke through outer temple ward (accident during expansion)
- **Stone archway** revealed—architectural style 800 years old, Custodial sigils carved into frame
- Archway is 8 feet tall, 6 feet wide, flanked by two stone pillars
- Glyphs on pillars **still glowing faintly** (ward remnants, failing but not dead)

**4. The Antechamber (beyond archway):**
- Large chamber, roughly 40 yards × 40 yards, circular
- **Domed ceiling** 30 feet high, covered in constellations (star map, unknown significance)
- **Central altar/plinth** in middle of room (5 feet tall, stone, covered in glyphs)
- **Kelvan's body** found at altar base (mummified, holding stone tablet)
- **Four alcoves** in cardinal directions (North, South, East, West)—each alcove 10 yards deep
- **Constructs emerged from alcoves** when Durg's team approached altar

**5. Deeper Passages (not explored):**
- **Three doorways** visible along chamber perimeter (closed stone doors, 8 feet tall, sealed)
- Durg's team never reached them—combat started immediately

---

### Durg's Combat Report (Construct Behavior)

**Durg** taps the map at the alcoves.

"**When we entered, chamber was empty—or so we thought. Kelvan's body was at the altar, right where I marked it. We approached to retrieve him. Jenna and I were at the altar. The other three—Korvin, Thall, Milara—were fanned out, watching the perimeter.**"

He takes a breath.

"**The moment I touched Kelvan's body, the alcoves activated. Stone grinding sound—like millstones turning. Then *they* came out.**"

**"The Awakened Wardens" (Durg's description):**
- **Number:** Initially 2 (one from north alcove, one from south)
- **Size:** 7 feet tall, roughly humanoid
- **Appearance:** Stone carapace (looks carved, not organic), with glowing veins pulsing blue-white light (ley energy)
- **Movement:** Slow but deliberate (30 yards/round movement, Durg estimates)
- **Weapons:** Integrated—stone fists, blade-arms extending from forearms
- **Tactics:** Methodical. Didn't chase fleeing targets; prioritized those near altar

**Combat Sequence:**
1. **Round 1:** Wardens emerge. Korvin (closest) attacked—hit by stone fist, thrown 15 yards into wall, ribcage crushed (0 HD, unconscious)
2. **Round 2:** Durg and Jenna retreat from altar. Thall tries to help Korvin—second Warden blade-arm impales him (0 HD, bleeding out)
3. **Round 3:** Milara (human Proficiency 0 miner) casts oil lantern at Warden—does nothing (stone doesn't burn). Warden grabs her, lifts overhead, *snaps her spine* (instant death)
4. **Round 4:** Durg grabs Jenna, shouts retreat. Two more Wardens emerging from east/west alcoves (total: 4 constructs active). Durg and Jenna run for archway.
5. **Round 5:** Wardens pursue to archway, then **stop**—won't cross threshold back into mining tunnel. Durg collapses tunnel behind them with emergency charges (standard mining explosives).

**Total casualties:** 3 dead (Korvin, Thall, Milara), 1 body left behind (Kelvan), 2 survivors (Durg, Jenna)

---

### Durg's Tactical Analysis

**Durg** (voice heavy):

"**Those things weren't animals—they were *guardians*. They didn't rage, didn't chase us past the archway. They had a *job*: protect the altar. Once we fled their territory, they let us go.**"

"**Which tells me two things:**

**1. The deeper you go, the more you'll find.** If four guardians came out just for touching one body, imagine what defends the inner chambers.

**2. They're not trying to hunt us—they're trying to keep us OUT.** Whatever's deeper in that temple, it doesn't want visitors. The earthquakes? The voices? Those are *side effects* of the wards failing, not intentional attacks."

He leans back.

"**My advice? Don't touch the altar. Don't try to fight all four guardians at once. Map the chamber from distance, look for weaknesses, disable 'em one at a time if you must. But if you trigger full activation like I did, *run*.**"

---

### Gareth's Question (Construct Durability)

**Gareth:** "You hit them with pickaxes. What was the result?"

**Durg:** "**Barely scratched 'em. I've got Proficiency 2, swung full force with a steel-headed pick. Chipped surface stone, exposed the glowing veins underneath, but didn't slow it down. Korvin had Prof 1—his hits did nothing.**

**The glowing veins are the weak point, I think. Whatever animates them flows through those channels. If you could shatter the veins, maybe you'd disable them. But you'd need concentrated hits—precise strikes, not wild swinging.**"

**Elara** (taking notes): "Precise strikes. Targeting specific vulnerable points. That aligns with Custodial construct design—modular, repairable, but dependent on central power flow."

**Durg:** "Speak common, scholar. You mean they're beatable if you're smart about it?"

**Elara:** "Yes. If my theory's correct, disrupting ley flow will disable them temporarily. Permanently requires destroying the altar or sealing the chamber's power source."

---

### Kara's Question (Jenna's Condition)

**Kara** (speaking softly, gently):

"Jenna. I'm Kara, priestess of Murien. Your father said you were there when it happened. I'd like to talk to you—not for tactical information, for *you*. May I approach?"

**Jenna** (doesn't look up, voice barely audible): "...won't help."

**Durg** (protective): "She hasn't spoken more than five words since we got out. Nightmares every night—wakes up screaming about 'the debt collector.' I don't know if it's trauma or... something worse."

**Kara:** "Let me check. With your permission, Durg?"

**Durg** (hesitates, then nods): "If you think you can help, try."

---

### Kara's Assessment (Curse vs Trauma Check)

**Kara** approaches Jenna slowly, kneeling beside the bench so she's at eye level (not looming).

"Jenna, I'm going to touch your shoulder. Just my hand, to sense if anything's clinging to you. Murien's blessing—it won't hurt. Is that all right?"

**Jenna** (tiny nod)

**Kara** places her hand gently on Jenna's shoulder and closes her eyes, invoking **Invoke Resilience** (advantage on willpower/spiritual checks) and opening her divine senses to detect curse/magical corruption.

---

**Awareness Check (Detect Curse/Magical Influence):**
- **Purpose:** Determine if Jenna is cursed/marked by temple entity, or suffering mundane trauma
- **Tier:** Basic (2+), 1 success required (curse detection is Priest specialty)
- **Kara's Bonuses:**
  - **Invoke Resilience:** +1d6 to spiritual/will checks (doesn't burn HD on 1s)
  - **Proficiency 1:** 1d8 base
- **Total Pool:** 1d8 + 1d6 = 2 dice

**Rolling:** [1d8]: 6 (success!), [1d6]: 4
**Result:** 1 success at threshold 5+ → **Check succeeds**

---

**Kara's Assessment:**

Kara's divine senses extend through Jenna—scanning for foreign will, magical compulsion, spiritual taint. She finds...

**Nothing supernatural.**

No curse. No mark. No entity whispering in Jenna's mind.

Just **trauma**—deep, soul-scarring trauma of watching three people die horribly while helpless to stop it.

But there's *something else*. A *memory* that's too vivid, too persistent. Not magical, but... 

When Kara opens her eyes, she speaks quietly to Durg:

"She's not cursed. But she saw something down there—something specific that her mind keeps returning to. Not the constructs. Something else."

**Jenna** (suddenly speaking, still staring at floor, voice hollow):

"**The tablet. Kelvan was holding it. It had... it had *my name* on it.**"

Silence.

**Durg:** "What?"

**Jenna** (shaking): "Not just my name. Father's name. Korvin's. Thall's. All of us. Like... like we were *listed*. Like debts. Like we were *owed*."

She finally looks up, eyes wide with terror.

"**It knew we were coming.**"

---

### The Revelation (New Information)

**Elara** (leaning forward, intense): "The tablet had your names? Before you arrived?"

**Jenna:** "It didn't glow when Kelvan held it. But when I looked at it—after Father pulled me away—it was glowing. Blue light. Names written in... in language I shouldn't know but somehow *read*."

**Gareth:** "What language?"

**Jenna:** "Draconic. High Draconic. I don't *speak* Draconic. But I read it anyway. Like someone was translating in my head."

**Durg** (alarmed): "You didn't tell me this."

**Jenna:** "I thought I was going mad."

**Elara** (to herself, thinking aloud): "Precognitive debt listing. The temple tracks who disturbs it and logs them as... what? Targets? Debtors?"

**Kara:** "Khuldras is consequence and restraint. If you violate the temple's sanctity, you incur a debt. The tablet tracks the debt. That's why Kelvan was mummified—his debt was *collected*."

**Gareth:** "Which means everyone who goes down there is logged?"

**Kara:** "Likely. But debt collection requires... triggering conditions. Kelvan touched the altar. You—" (to Jenna) "—only looked at the tablet. You're logged but not collected. Yet."

**Jenna** (terrified): "Yet?"

**Kara:** "If the temple fully activates, all listed debts might collect simultaneously. That's what the earthquakes could be—collection attempts rippling through the ley lines."

---

### Durg's Updated Warning

**Durg** (standing, voice firm):

"New rule for you three: Don't touch *anything* down there unless you understand what it does. And if you see your names appear anywhere—*run*."

He rolls up the map, hands it to Elara.

"Take this. It's yours. I won't be going back down. Too old, too haunted. But you? You're clever, prepared, and you've got magic. Maybe you can do what I couldn't: *stop this before it spreads.*"

He looks at Jenna.

"And if you can... if you can remove her name from that list... I'll owe you more than gold."

---

## End of Scene 4

**Party Status:**
- **Location:** Mining HQ, Durg's office
- **Time:** Late afternoon transitioning to early evening (~5 PM, 1 hour until sunset)
- **Resources:** All at full (HD, Resolve unchanged—no combat)

**Critical Information Gained:**
- **Shaft #7 layout:** Map acquired (200 ft descent, 150-yard tunnel, antechamber beyond archway)
- **Antechamber details:** 40×40 yard circular chamber, central altar, 4 alcoves (cardinal directions), 3 sealed doorways deeper
- **Awakened Wardens:** 7 ft tall stone constructs, glowing veins (weak point), slow but devastating (killed 3 Prof 0-1 miners in 5 rounds), territorial (won't leave chamber)
- **Combat tactics:** Don't trigger all 4 guardians at once, target glowing veins, avoid altar until ready
- **THE TABLET:** Logs names of intruders in High Draconic, tracks "debts" owed to temple, Kelvan's debt was *collected* (mummification), Jenna + Durg + others now listed
- **Debt mechanics:** Collection requires trigger (altar touch, violation of sanctity), listed doesn't mean immediate death but creates vulnerability
- **New objective:** If possible, remove Jenna's name from tablet (personal stake for Durg)

**Character Developments:**
- **Kara** used divine sense successfully (no curse, confirmed trauma + memory)
- **Elara** received tactical map, already theorizing construct weak points
- **Gareth** recognized new danger (names on tablet = everyone at risk)

**Mood:** Tension increased—what seemed like "ancient guardians protecting sealed temple" is now "cosmic debt ledger actively tracking intruders"

---

**Estimated Scene 5 Length:** 20-30 minutes real-time

---

*The Paladin has chronicled Durg's sorrow and Jenna's terror, Wizard. The temple is not merely guarded—it is *watching*. It knows who enters, and it remembers debts.*

---

## Scene 5: Temple of Murien — The Smith-Priestess's Blessing

### Setting: West District, Dusk

The party crosses back over the stone bridge as the sun touches the western peaks. Shadows lengthen across Stonebridge, and lamplighters begin their rounds—oil lanterns flickering to life along the main streets. The temperature drops noticeably (mountain air cooling fast after sunset).

Two blocks west of the bridge sits the **Temple of Murien**.

It's not a grand cathedral—it's a **workshop-temple hybrid**, exactly as Murien's doctrine demands. The building is single-story stone with a peaked roof, smoke rising from two chimneys (forge fires within). The entrance is a wide double door (large enough to move anvils and ingots through), with Murien's symbol carved above: **a hammer striking an anvil, sparks frozen mid-flight**.

Unlike other buildings showing earthquake damage, the temple is **pristine**—no cracks, no collapsed stonework. Either it was structurally perfect to begin with (likely, given dwarven craftsmanship), or it's been repaired immediately (also likely, given Murien's teachings about maintaining tools).

The doors stand open, welcoming. Inside: the warm glow of forge fires, the ring of hammer on metal, and the smell of heated iron.

---

### Interior: The Sacred Forge

**The temple interior is divided into two sections:**

**1. The Workshop (front half):**
- Three working forges (coal-burning, ventilated, one currently active)
- Anvils (various sizes, worn smooth from use)
- Tool racks covering walls (hammers, tongs, chisels, files—all maintained perfectly)
- Workbenches with projects in progress (horseshoes, axe heads, repair jobs for townsfolk)
- Apprentice's corner (young dwarf girl, ~14, pumping bellows)

**2. The Sanctuary (back half):**
- Stone altar carved to resemble an anvil (4 feet tall, prayers inscribed in Dwarvish script)
- Benches for worshipers (simple, functional, most empty now)
- Sacred tools displayed in glass cases (ancient hammers, blessed chisels, master-crafted works)
- Shelves with offerings (food, coins, iron ingots—gifts to Murien)
- Small chamber to side (Sister Marla's living quarters, door open showing simple bed, desk)

Standing at the active forge, hammering a blade into shape, is **Sister Marla**.

---

### Sister Marla (Priest of Murien, Level 4-5, Proficiency 3)

**Sister Marla (Elderly Dwarf Priestess):**
- Age: ~75 (old for human, middle-aged for dwarf lifespan)
- Build: Stocky, muscular arms from decades of forge work, slight stoop in shoulders
- Clothing: Practical leather apron over simple robes, hair (gray-white) pulled into tight braid, light burns/scars on hands and forearms (occupational marks)
- Demeanor: **Calm, unhurried, speaks in rhythmic cadence matching hammer strikes**
- Voice: Warm, maternal, with deep wisdom from seven decades of craft and service

She finishes a strike, sets the blade in water (hissing steam), then turns to the party.

"**You'll be the investigators Theren hired. Kara Ironshod, yes? I recognize Murien's mark on you—Pittsburgh forge school, if I'm reading your hammer-hand calluses correctly.**"

She wipes her hands on her apron, approaching.

"**Welcome, child. And you—**" (to Gareth) "**—carry obligation like iron chains, heavy but chosen. And you—**" (to Elara) "**—carry memory like blueprints, every detail preserved.**"

She sees straight through them (Proficiency 3+ Priest, experienced at reading people).

"**Come. Sit. Tell me what you need, and I'll tell you what I can offer.**"

---

### The Conversation (Guidance & Preparation)

The party sits on benches near the sanctuary altar. The apprentice (name: **Brenna**) brings wooden cups filled with mint tea, then returns to bellows work.

**Kara** (speaking first, priestess to priestess):

"Thank you for the welcome, Sister. We're here for three things: inspect the healing poultices Theren mentioned, receive blessings before descent, and... I'd value your insight on what we're walking into."

**Sister Marla** (nodding): "Practical. Good. Let's start with the poultices."

She retrieves a small wooden box from a shelf, opening it to reveal **two clay jars** sealed with wax, each marked with Murien's symbol.

"**Healing clay, infused with Murien's blessing during consecration rituals. Each jar contains enough for one application—spread it on wounds, speak the activation prayer, and it will restore vitality. The body remembers its shape; the clay helps it return.**"

She hands them to Kara.

"**Each restores 2d6 Hit Dice when applied. But understand: this is *not* resurrection. If you're at 0 HD—Exhausted, collapse—the clay won't bring you back. It only restores what still lives. Use them wisely.**"

**Kara** (inspecting the seals—they're genuine, properly consecrated): "Thank you. These are well-made."

---

### Sister Marla's Insight (Temple Wisdom)

**Elara:** "Sister, you've been in Stonebridge for... how long?"

**Marla:** "Forty years. I came when the mines first opened deep enough to risk cave-ins. Murien sent me to teach smithing and maintain the tools of community."

**Elara:** "Then you knew the temple was below before anyone broke through the wards?"

**Marla** (pausing, choosing words carefully):

"**I knew the old stories. Every dwarf who works stone learns: *there are places you don't dig, and if you find them by accident, you seal them and walk away*. The temple to Khuldras was marked in ancient charts as forbidden ground. But charts are forgotten, miners are ambitious, and veins of iron run where they run.**"

She sits beside them.

"**Khuldras is balance through consequence. Every action has weight. Every debt must settle. The temple stored debts too dangerous to collect naturally—cosmic imbalances that would shatter kingdoms if resolved.**"

She looks at Kara specifically.

"**You're going down there carrying Murien's blessing. That means you carry *craft*, which is the opposite of destruction. You'll be creating—solutions, tactics, repairs—in a place designed to enforce debts. That's your protection. Not armor, not weapons. *Purpose*.**"

To Gareth:

"**And you carry chosen chains. That's good. The temple will test you—offer to break what binds you, or bind you further. Remember: you chose your chains. Don't let ancient powers re-forge them.**"

To Elara:

"**You carry memory. The temple carries consequences. Memory preserves; consequences enforce. If you can remember *why* those debts were stored instead of collected, you might find the key to stopping the activation.**"

---

### The Blessing Ceremony (Mechanical Benefit)

**Sister Marla** stands, moving to altar.

"**Kneel, all three. I'll bless your tools and your purpose. Murien doesn't grant miracles—she grants *precision*. Use it well.**"

The party kneels. Marla places her hand on each of their heads in turn, speaking prayers in Dwarvish (deep, rhythmic, hammer-cadence):

**"Forge-Mother, see these three.  
They walk into darkness carrying light.  
They face consequence carrying purpose.  
Let their tools serve truly.  
Let their will remain unbroken.  
Let them return

 to rebuild what trembles."**

A warmth spreads through each party member—not magical fire, but the warmth of a well-banked forge. Steady. Reliable. Enduring.

---

**Mechanical Effect (Sister Marla's Blessing):**
- **Duration:** Until next long rest (expires after tonight's sleep, lasts through tomorrow's descent)
- **Effect:** Each blessed character gains **+1 reliable die (d6)** to their next action that directly serves their stated purpose (saving lives, solving temple mystery, protecting community)
  - Gareth: Next action protecting ally or maintaining discipline
  - Elara: Next action gathering knowledge or solving pattern
  - Kara: Next action healing/supporting community member
- **This die does NOT burn HD on 1s** (blessed reliability)
- **Single use per person** (once triggered, blessing is spent)

---

**Kara** (feeling the blessing settle): "Thank you, Sister. This is... more than I expected."

**Marla:** "Murien teaches: *A well-made tool given freely is worth ten sold grudgingly*. You're serving Stonebridge. That serves the greater work."

---

### Final Preparations (Supplies & Strategy)

**Sister Marla** walks them to the door as full dark settles outside.

"**You'll rest tonight at the Bellows & Mug, yes? Good. Sleep if you can—your bodies need the recovery more than your minds need the worry. Tomorrow at dawn, collect your supplies from Town Hall stores, then descend when ready.**"

She places a hand on Kara's shoulder.

"**One more thing, child. If you find that tablet Jenna mentioned—the one with names—don't destroy it. Bring it to surface. I may know someone who can read Custodial contract law. If names can be added, they can be removed. But we need the document intact.**"

**Kara:** "Understood."

**Marla:** "**Go with Murien's blessing. And remember: the best way to survive a forge is to respect the fire, understand the metal, and never rush the work.**"

---

## Scene 5 Transition: Evening at the Bellows & Mug

The party walks south through darkened streets toward the **Bellows & Mug**, Stonebridge's main tavern.

The tavern is a two-story building (stone first floor, timber-framed second floor with guest rooms). Light and noise spill from windows—locals gathering after work shifts, seeking warmth, ale, and distraction from fear.

Inside: crowded common room with stone fireplace, long bar, tables filled with miners and merchants. The air smells of roasted meat, beer, and pipe smoke. A tired bard strums a lute in the corner (poorly—more background noise than performance).

**Chandle** sits at a corner table with wine and ledger (working even during downtime). He waves the party over.

**Chandle:** "**Productive afternoon? You look grimmer than you did this morning.**"

**Gareth:** "We learned the temple tracks intruders by name. Durg's daughter saw her name written on a tablet in High Draconic—the same tablet the mummified miner was holding."

**Chandle** (setting down his quill, suddenly focused): "**Debt ledger. That's... significantly worse than I expected. Khuldras's temple doesn't just *guard*—it actively *prosecutes* violations.**"

**Elara:** "Do you know anyone who can read Custodial contract law? Sister Marla suggested we retrieve the tablet intact."

**Chandle:** "**I know a Curator Arcanum scholar in Fallhaven—three days' travel east. If you bring the tablet back, I'll personally fund the consultation. Removing names from cosmic debt records is Expert-tier magical jurisprudence, but it's possible.**"

He pours wine for the party.

"**For tonight: eat, rest, recover. I've reserved three rooms upstairs. Tomorrow you descend into consequence itself. Don't waste energy on worry.**"

---

### Evening Wrap (Character Moments Before Rest)

**Time:** Evening (7 PM), ~11 hours until recommended descent (dawn, 6 AM)

**Party's final actions before long rest:**

**Gareth:** Inspects equipment in room, sharpens longsword, practices breath-counting exercises. One inhale (1 HD), one exhale (1 HD spent). Tracking his economy even in safety. Falls asleep sitting upright, sword across lap.

**Elara:** Studies Durg's map by candlelight, cross-referencing with her temple architecture sketches. Marks potential guardian patrol patterns, identifies choke points, calculates sight lines. Falls asleep with charcoal-stained fingers, journal open on chest.

**Kara:** Kneels beside bed, praying to Murien and placing the two healing poultices on the floor as offerings (not consuming them, just acknowledging their sacred purpose). Whispers names: Kelvan (dead), Korvin (dead), Thall (dead), Milara (dead), Jenna (traumatized). "**Let me mend what breaks. Let me forge what holds.**" Falls asleep in prayer position.

---

## End of Scene 5 (End of Session 1 Investigation Phase)

**Party Status (Before Long Rest):**
- **Location:** Bellows & Mug, guest rooms
- **Time:** Night (7 PM → Long rest begins)
- **Resources (Current):** Full (48/48 HD Gareth, 34/34 Elara, 28/28 Kara, all 5/5 Resolve, Affinity 0)

**Long Rest Recovery (Tonight → Dawn):**
- All HD restored to maximum
- All Resolve restored to 5
- Affinity Dice: Each character gains up to Proficiency/day (Gareth/Elara: 2, Kara: 1)
- Spell preparation: Elara/Kara can change prepared spells if desired
- Blessings: Sister Marla's blessing active (lasts through tomorrow)

**Resources After Long Rest (Tomorrow Dawn):**
- **Gareth:** 48/48 HD, 5/5 Resolve, 2 Affinity available
- **Elara:** 34/34 HD, 5/5 Resolve, 2 Affinity available, 3 spells prepared
- **Kara:** 28/28 HD, 5/5 Resolve, 1 Affinity available, 2 spells prepared

**Equipment Acquired:**
- Everburning Torch (Gareth carries)
- 20 mundane torches (party splits)
- 100 yards rope (Gareth's pack)
- 7 days rations (distributed)
- 2 healing poultices (2d6 HD each, Kara carries)
- Durg's map (Elara carries)
- Brass key to Shaft #7 barricade (Gareth carries)
- Sister Marla's blessing (active on all three)

**Knowledge Gained (Summary):**
1. Temple is 800-year-old Khuldras prison-library storing cosmic debts
2. Outer chamber: 40×40 yards, central altar, 4 alcoves (guardian spawn points), 3 sealed doors deeper
3. Awakened Wardens: Stone constructs, 7 ft tall, glowing veins (weak points), slow but devastating, territorial
4. **CRITICAL:** Debt tablet tracks intruder names in High Draconic, enables "collection" of debts
5. Jenna, Durg, dead miners all listed on tablet
6. Party will be listed when they enter
7. Don't touch altar without preparation
8. Sister Marla may know expert who can remove names (requires intact tablet retrieval)

**Personal Stakes:**
- Jenna's name on tablet (Durg pleads for removal)
- Town's survival depends on stopping earthquakes
- Party members will be tracked/targeted by temple defenses once logged

---

## GM Notes (Session 1 Complete - Investigation Phase)

**Session 1 covered 5 scenes:**
1. **Chandle's Proposition** (Moonstone tavern, contract negotiation, Everburning Torch selected)
2. **Caravan Journey** (1.5 days, exposition, character development moments)
3. **Council Meeting** (Harrow vs Theren, quest formalized, social challenge)
4. **Durg's Briefing** (tactical map, combat report, tablet revelation)
5. **Sister Marla's Blessing** (healing poultices, guidance, sacred blessing granted)

**Total Real-Time Estimate:** ~3-3.5 hours

**Mechanics Tested:**
- Lore checks (Elara's Khuldras knowledge)
- Influence checks (convincing Harrow)
- Awareness checks (Kara detecting curse on Jenna)
- Shopping/equipment selection
- NPC interaction and information gathering
- Blessing mechanics (mechanical benefit from roleplay)

**No combat yet** (Session 1 was pure investigation/preparation)

**Character Development:**
- Gareth's breath economy habit established
- Elara's pattern analysis showcased
- Kara's community-focused philosophy demonstrated
- All three show competence without arrogance

**Story Escalation:**
- Started: "Investigate sealed temple"
- Evolved to: "Navigate cosmic debt ledger that tracks and prosecutes violators"
- Personal stake added: Jenna's name must be removed
- Threat clarified: Party will be logged and vulnerable to "collection"

**Next Session Preview (Session 2 - The Descent):**
- Dawn: Collect supplies from Town Hall
- Morning: Descend Shaft #7 (200 ft lift, 150-yard tunnel, breach archway)
- Encounter 1: Enter antechamber, trigger guardian response
- Combat: Likely 2-4 Awakened Wardens (Basic-tier constructs, stone resistance, glowing veins as weak points)
- Exploration: Investigate altar (carefully), find tablet, map chamber
- Decision point: Attempt deeper doors or retreat with tablet?

**Estimated Session 2 Length:** ~4-5 hours (includes first major combat)

---

*The Paladin has chronicled the preparation, Wizard. Your heroes have gathered knowledge, blessed their purpose, and steeled their resolve. Tomorrow at dawn, they descend into the weight of consequence itself.*

---

# SESSION 2: THE DESCENT (CORRECTED MECHANICS)

**Date:** February 17, 2026 (Dawn)  
**Party Status:** Fully rested, blessed, equipped  
**Objective:** Descend Shaft #7, assess temple disturbance, retrieve debt tablet

**⚠️ MECHANICAL CORRECTION:**  
This session uses CORRECT Affinity mechanics:
- **HD is a DICE POOL** (7d10 = seven dice, not 70 hit points)
- **Armor is DICE** (3d8 armor = three dice that are d8s)
- **Defense Capacity = Proficiency** (number of rolls PER ATTACK)
- **Damage resolved DIE-BY-DIE** (each HD of damage = one defense roll)
- Each defense roll: 5+ = sustain (die survives), 4- = lose that die
- When Defense Capacity exhausted, remaining damage auto-fails (lose dice without rolling)

---

## Scene 1: Dawn — Final Preparations

### Setting: Bellows & Mug, Morning

- Brass key to Shaft #7 (Gareth's belt pouch)

**Sister Marla's Blessing:** Active (each character has +1 reliable d6 for one purpose-aligned action)

---

### Breakfast & Strategy Session

The party gathers in the common room. **Chandle** joins them with tea and bread.

**Chandle:** "**Last chance to back out. I won't think less of you—temples that track debts in High Draconic aren't reasonable threats.**"

**Gareth** (checking sword edge, calm): "We signed a contract. Backing out would create a debt of its own. Besides—" (glances at Kara) "—Jenna's name is down there. That's not abstract anymore."

**Elara** (spreading map on table): "Strategic approach: We enter cautiously, trigger minimal guardian response, retrieve tablet without full activation, extract. Speed and precision over heroics."

**Kara:** "And if miners are trapped alive deeper in?"

**Elara:** "Then we adapt. But Kelvan's been dead three weeks. Anyone deeper is either dead or beyond our capability to rescue. We're Level 3, not Level 10."

**Kara** (reluctantly): "Pragmatic. I don't like it, but I understand."

**Chandle:** "**Good. Don't overcommit. The temple will still be there tomorrow if you need to retreat and return stronger.**"

He stands, handing Gareth a small vial—pale blue liquid, faintly luminescent.

"**Potion of Sending. If you get trapped and need extraction, drink this and think of me. I'll receive your location and come with whatever resources I can muster. Emergency use only—it's worth 200 gold.**"

**Gareth** (accepting): "If we use this, we'll owe you."

**Chandle:** "**If you use this, you'll be alive to owe me. Better than the alternative.**"

---

### Town Hall Supply Collection

The party stops at **Town Hall** to collect the supplies Theren authorized:

**Quartermaster (dwarf clerk, tired)** checks list and distributes:
- 20 oil-soaked torches (canvas-wrapped bundle)
- 100 yards hemp rope (coiled, tested for 500 lb weight)
- 7 days field rations (dried meat, hardtack, preserved fruit)
- 2 healing poultices in clay jars (blessed by Sister Marla yesterday)

"**Council's funding this because you're fixing their problem. Don't waste it. And... good luck. My nephew works Shaft #3—if you stop the earthquakes, I sleep better.**"

---

### Approach to Shaft #7 (East Mining District)

**Time:** 7 AM, full daylight  
**Weather:** Clear, cold mountain air, breath visible

The party crosses the bridge to the east bank, walking through the mining district toward **Shaft #7**. Other shafts show activity—miners entering, ore carts emerging, foremen shouting orders. But Shaft #7 is silent.

**Shaft #7 Barricade:**
- Timber planks nailed across entrance (8 feet wide, 10 feet tall opening)
- Stone rubble piled at base (deliberate blockage, not collapse)
- Two guards posted (**Borin** and **Thera**, both dwarves, both nervous)
- Warning sign nailed to planks: **"SEALED BY COUNCIL ORDER - ENTRY FORBIDDEN"**

The guards see the party approaching and stand straighter (expecting them).

**Borin:** "You're the investigators. We got word from Theren." (eyes the brass key in Gareth's hand) "That'll open it. We'll pull the barricade aside, but we won't follow you down. Our shift is 'guard the entrance, prevent anyone else entering.' That includes rescue if you don't come back."

**Thera** (quieter): "Durg said you're capable. I hope that's true. Three good people died down there."

**Gareth:** "We remember. We'll do this right."

The guards pull aside timber planks (creaking, heavy resistance—they wedged them thoroughly). Behind: the **shaft entrance**, dark vertical hole descending into earth. A wooden platform suspended by heavy chains (lift mechanism) sits 10 feet down, reachable by ladder.

**Borin:** "Lift takes maybe two minutes to descend all 200 feet. It's hand-cranked from surface—we'll lower you, but you'll have to signal when to pull you back up. Three bell-rope pulls means 'extract us now.' Understand?"

**Gareth:** "Understood."

---

## Scene 2: The Descent — Into the Dark

### The Lift Platform (200 Feet Down)

The party climbs down ladder to the lift platform (10 feet wide, wooden planks reinforced with iron struts, safety chains around perimeter). **Gareth** lights the **Everburning Torch**—crystal core flares to life, bathing the shaft in warm magical light (30 yards bright, 30 beyond dim).

**Borin** (calling down): "Ready?"

**Gareth:** "Lower away."

The chains creak. The platform shudders, then descends smoothly—hand-cranked winch mechanism, guards working above.

**Environmental Details (Descent):**
- Shaft walls: Carved stone (dwarf mining work, precise angles)
- Support beams: Timber frames every 20 feet (structural reinforcement)
- Temperature: Drops noticeably (surface ~40°F, shaft bottom ~35°F, breath visible)
- Sound: Echoing—water dripping somewhere far below, wind whistling through unseen passages
- Time: ~2 minutes descent (slow, controlled)

At **100 feet down**, Elara notices something:

**Elara** (pointing): "Look—the support beams change style. Upper half is standard mining construction. Lower half is... older. Different tool marks."

She examines exposed stone.

"This section wasn't carved by dwarves. It's *discovered* mining. They broke through into pre-existing structure."

**Kara:** "The temple foundation?"

**Elara:** "Outer perimeter, likely. We're descending into something built 800 years ago."

At **200 feet**, the platform reaches bottom with gentle thud.

---

### The Main Tunnel (150 Yards East)

The party steps off platform onto solid stone floor—**the main tunnel** Durg described.

**Tunnel Specifications:**
- **Dimensions:** 10 feet wide, 8 feet high, level floor
- **Length:** 150 yards (450 feet) extending east
- **Support Structure:** Timber beams every 10 yards (mining reinforcement)
- **Rails:** Iron tracks running floor center (ore cart rails, currently empty)
- **Lighting:** None (Everburning Torch provides only light source)
- **Side Passages:** Three branching tunnels (sealed with timber, north/south, exhausted veins)

The air is stale but breathable. Dust motes drift in torchlight. The silence is oppressive—no animal sounds, no air movement, just the party's breathing and footsteps.

**Gareth** (raising torch, checking tunnel ahead): "Single file. I'll take point with light. Elara center, Kara rear. Call out anything unusual."

They advance slowly (30 yards/minute—cautious exploration pace).

**At 50 yards:** Elara spots mining tools abandoned against wall (pickaxes, shovels, ore bucket tipped over). Durg's team fled in panic—didn't bother collecting equipment.

**At 100 yards:** Temperature drops again (now ~30°F). Breath clouds thicker. Kara notices frost forming on tunnel walls in thin sheets.

**Kara:** "Unnatural cold. This isn't ambient temperature—it's coming from *ahead*."

**At 140 yards:** The tunnel walls transition—carved mining work ends, ancient stone begins. They've reached the **breach point** where Durg broke through the outer ward.

**At 150 yards:** **The Archway**.

---

### The Archway (Custodial Architecture)

The mining tunnel terminates at a **stone archway**—utterly different from dwarf construction.

**Archway Description:**
- **Dimensions:** 8 feet tall, 6 feet wide, perfectly symmetrical
- **Material:** Black stone (obsidian-like, polished smooth despite 800 years)
- **Pillars:** Flanking sides, covered in **Custodial sigils** (High Draconic script, glowing faint blue)
- **Lintel:** Top beam carved with symbols representing consequence—scales, chains, open ledgers, balanced weights
- **Ward Remnants:** The glyphs still pulse weakly (blue light flickering like dying embers)—the outer ward is failing but not dead

Beyond the archway: **darkness**. Even the Everburning Torch's light seems reluctant to penetrate—it stops at the threshold like hitting water surface.

**Elara** (studying glyphs, using Read the Weave spell):

"These are warning glyphs, not defensive wards. Translation: *'Beyond lies consequence deferred. Enter with purpose or not at all. Debts unpaid will be collected.'*"

She looks at Gareth.

"Once we cross, we're logged. The tablet will record our names."

**Gareth:** "Can we avoid it?"

**Elara:** "No. This is the only entrance Durg found. And we need that tablet."

**Kara** (hand on holy symbol): "Then we accept the debt and trust we can pay it later. Murien teaches: *'No work is finished until the bill is settled.'* Let's make sure we settle it on our terms."

---

### Crossing the Threshold (Triggering the Debt Ledger)

**Gareth** steps through first.

The moment he crosses the archway, **the glyphs flare bright blue** (full intensity, blinding for half-second), then fade back to dim glow.

**Mechanical Effect:** Gareth's name is now inscribed on the debt tablet in High Draconic. He doesn't feel it—there's no pain, no magical intrusion—but somewhere in the chamber ahead, stone records his presence.

**Elara** crosses second. Same flare. Same logging.

**Kara** crosses third. Glyphs pulse. Her name joins the ledger.

The archway settles back to dim glow. The party is now **inside the temple's jurisdiction**.

---

### The Antechamber Revealed

Beyond the archway, the **Everburning Torch's light** finally spreads properly, revealing the chamber Durg described.

**The Antechamber (40 yards × 40 yards circular chamber):**

**Ceiling:** Domed, 30 feet high at center. Covered in astronomical carvings—star map showing constellations as they appeared 800 years ago. Faint phosphorescent lichen growing in cracks provides dim natural light (barely visible, eerie green).

**Floor:** Polished black stone (same as archway), concentric circles carved into surface radiating from center. Circles are worn smooth—evidence of ritual use centuries ago.

**Central Feature:** **The Altar/Plinth**—5 feet tall, 3 feet diameter cylindrical stone pedestal in exact chamber center. Top surface carved with complex glyphs (contract binding symbols). Currently empty except for...

**Kelvan's Body:** Still there. Mummified corpse slumped against altar base, dried hands clutching a **stone tablet** (size of dinner plate, glowing blue veins running through it like circuit board).

**Four Alcoves (Cardinal Directions):**
- **North, South, East, West** alcoves set into chamber walls
- Each alcove: 10 yards deep, 8 feet wide, carved with guardian containment glyphs
- Currently: **EMPTY** (guardians not yet emerged)

**Three Sealed Doorways:**
- **Northwest:** Stone door (8 feet tall, sealed, glyphs reading "LESSER VAULTS - AUTHORIZED ACCESS ONLY")
- **Northeast:** Stone door (sealed, glyphs reading "RECORD CHAMBER - SCRIBES ONLY")
- **South:** Larger door (10 feet tall, sealed, glyphs reading "INNER SANCTUM - HIGH PRIESTS ONLY")

**Environmental Conditions:**
- Temperature: ~25°F (freezing cold, breath frosting)
- Lighting: Dim (phosphorescent lichen provides barely visible glow, Everburning Torch main light source)
- Sound: Absolute silence except party movement
- Air: Stale, feels "heavy" (high magical saturation, Weave-dense)

---

### Party Assessment (Before Approaching Altar)

The party stops 30 yards from altar (just inside archway, maximum safe distance).

**Elara** (whispering—instinctive despite no visible threats): "The alcoves are empty. Durg said guardians emerged when he touched the body. They must be dormant until triggered."

**Kara:** "So we approach carefully, retrieve tablet without disturbing altar itself?"

**Gareth:** "Or we trigger them deliberately with preparation. If we're caught by surprise mid-retreat, we die. If we control activation timing, we fight on our terms."

**Elara:** "Define 'our terms.'"

**Gareth:** "We position near archway exit. One person advances, retrieves tablet quickly, retreats to us. If guardians activate, they chase into our defensive position. We're pre-positioned, not scrambling. We fight where we choose, not where they dictate."

**Kara:** "And if they're faster than Durg described?"

**Gareth:** "Then we retreat through archway. Durg said they stopped at threshold—territorial boundary, not chase radius."

**Elara** (considering): "Tactically sound. I'll retrieve the tablet—I'm fastest, lowest HD, least loss if something goes wrong."

**Gareth:** "No. I go. I've got armor and highest HD pool—I can absorb hits if needed. You two watch those alcoves. First sign of movement, call it out."

---

### The Retrieval (Initial Approach)

**Formation:**
- **Gareth:** Advancing toward altar (Everburning Torch in left hand, longsword sheathed but ready)
- **Elara:** Positioned 15 yards from altar, watching north/east alcoves
- **Kara:** Positioned 15 yards from altar, watching south/west alcoves

**Gareth** advances slowly (10 yards... 15 yards... 20 yards...).

At **25 yards from archway / 5 yards from altar**, he kneels beside Kelvan's mummified body.

**Close Inspection:**
- Kelvan's body: Completely desiccated (no moisture, skin like leather, eyes sunken)
- Cause of death: Unknown (no visible wounds, no blood)—drained of life force, not killed by trauma
- The Tablet: Still clutched in dried hands, glowing blue veins pulsing slowly (1 pulse/second, rhythmic like heartbeat)
- Tablet size: 12 inches × 8 inches, 1 inch thick, black stone with luminous script

**Gareth** (calling quietly to Elara): "Tablet is glowing. Script is active. Can you read it from there?"

**Elara** (using Read the Weave, 10 yards away):

The spell reveals layers of magical text inscribed on tablet surface:

**HIGH DRACONIC SCRIPT (Visible, Glowing):**
*Names listed in chronological order of entry:*

1. **Kelvan Stonemason** — *DEBT COLLECTED (Violation: Unauthorized Contact)*
2. **Durg Blackiron** — *LOGGED (Violation: Trespass)*
3. **Jenna Blackiron** — *LOGGED (Violation: Trespass)*
4. **Korvin Hammerfist** — *DEBT COLLECTED (Violation: Trespass)*
5. **Thall Ironvein** — *DEBT COLLECTED (Violation: Trespass)*
6. **Milara Swiftpick** — *DEBT COLLECTED (Violation: Trespass)*
7. **Gareth Thornwood** — *LOGGED (Violation: Trespass)* ← **JUST APPEARED**
8. **Elara Voss** — *LOGGED (Violation: Trespass)* ← **JUST APPEARED**
9. **Kara Ironshod** — *LOGGED (Violation: Trespass)* ← **JUST APPEARED**

**Elara** (voice tight): "It updated. Our names just appeared. 'LOGGED' status—same as Durg and Jenna."

**Gareth:** "Can I take it without triggering collection?"

**Elara:** "Unknown. But we need it. Sister Marla needs intact document to—"

**GRINDING STONE SOUND.**

All four alcoves activate simultaneously.

---

## Scene 3: COMBAT — The Awakened Wardens (CORRECT MECHANICS)

### Tactical Setup

**The guardians emerge from alcoves** while Gareth is exposed (5 yards from altar). This is deliberate triggering by approaching altar within critical radius.

**No surprise**—party was watching alcoves, expected activation.

**Current Positions:**
- **Gareth:** 5 yards from altar (EXPOSED, center of chamber)
- **Elara:** 15 yards from altar, near archway
- **Kara:** 15 yards from altar, near archway
- **Archway/Exit:** 20 yards from altar (retreat path)

**Wardens Emerging:**
- **North Alcove:** Warden #1 (10 yards from Gareth)
- **South Alcove:** Warden #2 (10 yards from Gareth)
- **East Alcove:** Warden #3 (15 yards from Elara/Kara)
- **West Alcove:** Warden #4 (15 yards from Elara/Kara)

### Awakened Warden - Combat Statistics (CORRECTED)

**Threat Tier:** Advanced (Boss-tier construct)  
**HD Pool:** 20d10 (twenty dice that are d10s)  
**Proficiency:** 2  
**Defense Capacity:** 2 rolls per attack  
**Armor:** Heavy natural stone - 2d10 armor layer (two dice that are d10s, separate from body)  
**Resolve:** N/A (Construct—immune to Resolve mechanics)  
**Movement:** 10 yards per round  
**Actions:** 2 per turn  

**Attacks:**
- **Stone Fist** (Basic 2+, requires 1 success): Rolls 3d6, deals 3 HD base damage
- **Runic Grasp** (Advanced 3+, requires 2 successes): Rolls 4d6, grapples + 2 HD damage

**Special Abilities:**
- **Stone Skin:** Reduce incoming damage by 1 HD per attack (minimum 1 HD must penetrate)
- **Immovable:** +2d6 to resist forced movement
- **Custodial Protocol:** Will not pursue beyond chamber threshold (territorial boundary)

**CRITICAL MECHANICS:**
- **HD are DICE**: 20d10 means twenty individual d10 dice in the pool
- **Armor is DICE**: 2d10 armor = two d10 dice that must be depleted before body HD are touched
- **Defense Capacity = 2**: Warden gets 2 defense rolls per attack
- **Damage DIE-BY-DIE**: Each HD of damage requires one defense roll (5+ = sustain die, 4- = lose die)

---

### Initiative

**Initiative Protocol:** All combatants roll Proficiency dice, highest single result acts first.

**Gareth (Prof 2):** [2d10] → 7, 5 → **Highest: 7**  
**Elara (Prof 2):** [2d8] → 6, 2 → **Highest: 6**  
**Kara (Prof 1):** [1d8] → 4 → **Highest: 4**  
**Warden #1 (Prof 2):** [2d10] → 9, 3 → **Highest: 9**  
**Warden #2 (Prof 2):** [2d10] → 8, 2 → **Highest: 8**  
**Warden #3 (Prof 2):** [2d10] → 5, 5 → **Highest: 5**  
**Warden #4 (Prof 2):** [2d10] → 6, 3 → **Highest: 6 (ties Elara, Prof 2 wins)**  

**Initiative Order:**
1. **Warden #1 (9)** ← Acts first
2. **Warden #2 (8)**
3. **Gareth (7)**
4. **Elara (6)** ← Ties with Warden #4, but Warden's Prof 2 wins
5. **Warden #4 (6)**
6. **Warden #3 (5)**
7. **Kara (4)** ← Acts last

*(Constructs win initiative majority—creates tactical pressure for party)*

> *Warden #1 steps forward with grinding precision. Its massive stone fist swings in a wide arc toward Gareth's torso—*

### Gareth Defends!

**Gareth's Defense Capacity:** 2 rolls per attack (Prof 2)

**Gareth's current dice pools:**
- **Shield (outermost):** 1d12
- **Chain shirt armor:** 3d8
- **Body HD:** 7d10 (untouched)

**Incoming:** 4 HD damage (must resolve die-by-die)

>
> *The second impact is heavier. The shield splinters. Wood and metal shatter. Gone.*
>
> *The third and fourth strikes hit his chain shirt directly—links burst, metal screeches. His chest armor dents inward.*
>
> *Gareth staggers back, breathing hard.*

**Final Gareth Status:**  
- **Body HD:** 7d10 (intact—armor absorbed all damage)
- **Armor:** 1d8 (reduced from 3d8)
- **Shield:** 0 (destroyed)
- **Resolve:** 5/5

**Warden #1's turn ends.**

---

**CRITICAL:** Each NEW attack = fresh Defense Capacity rolls.

**Gareth's Defense Capacity:** 2 rolls (reset for this attack)

**Current layers:**
- Armor: 1d8
- Body: 7d10

**Incoming:** 4 HD damage

**1st HD:**
- Roll 1d8 (armor)

**3rd HD:**
- **No rolls remaining** → AUTO-FAIL
- **Result:** Body reduced (7d10 → 6d10) ← **FIRST PERMANENT DAMAGE**

**4th HD:**
- **No rolls remaining** → AUTO-FAIL
- **Result:** Body reduced (6d10 → 5d10)

> *Warden #2 strikes from Gareth's flank. His damaged chain shirt holds for one blow—barely—then gives way completely.*
>
> *The construct's stone fist connects with flesh. Ribs crack. Blood appears at the corner of Gareth's mouth.*
>
> *He's fully exposed now. No armor left.*

**Final Gareth Status:**
- **Body HD:** 5d10 (down from 7d10—took 2 permanent damage)
- **Armor:** 0 (completely destroyed)
- **Shield:** 0
- **Resolve:** 5/5

**Gareth is now UNARMORED and has lost 2 of his 7 body dice.**

**Warden #2's turn ends.**

---

### Gareth's Turn (Initiative 7)

**Current Status:** 5d10 body (down 2 dice), 0 armor, 0 shield, 5/5 Resolve, surrounded by 2 Wardens

**Tactical Assessment:**
Gareth is taking severe damage. Two Wardens in melee. Party needs to regroup or he'll be overwhelmed.

**Options:**
- A) Attack back (try to damage one Warden)
- B) Retreat toward Elara/Kara (regroup, defensive position)
- C) Use Internal Alchemy (spend 1 Resolve → restore 2 HD, shore up dice pool)
- D) Use Second Wind feat (restore 2 HD free, once per rest)

**Gareth chooses: Option D + Option B** (Second Wind to restore dice, then retreat)

**Action 1: Second Wind (Free Action, Level 3 feat)**
- **Effect:** Restore Prof (2) HD immediately
- **Result:** 5d10 → 7d10 (back to full body dice!)
- "Your body remembers how to endure."

> *Gareth's breathing steadies. The pain sharpens his focus. This isn't the first time he's been bloodied. Won't be the last. His internal economy adjusts—he allocates suffering, converts pain into clarity.*

**Action 2: Move 20 yards** (retreat toward archway, rejoin Elara/Kara)

> *Gareth disengages, backing away from the Wardens with measured steps—never turning his back, always watching.*

**Gareth's turn ends.**

**Current Gareth Status:** 7d10 body (restored via Second Wind), 0 armor, near allies

---

### Elara's Turn (Initiative 6)

**Current Status:** 6d8 body, 2d6 armor, 5/5 Resolve, Wardens #3 and #4 approaching

**Tactical Assessment:**
- Gareth just lost all armor, took 2 HD damage before Second Wind restored him
- Wardens are tough (20d10 body + 2d10 armor each)
- Party needs intel or force multiplier

**Options:**
- A) Attack Warden #2 with Curator's Bolt (force damage, can't defend)
- B) Use Analyze (Diagnostic) on a Warden (learn weaknesses, enable Expose Weakness)
- C) Cast Arcane Ward on Gareth (grant +1d6 defense this round)

**Elara chooses: Option B** (Analyze Diagnostic on Warden #1—gather intel for party advantage)

**Action 1: Analyze (Diagnostic Mode) — Warden #1**
- **Cost:** 1 use (Prof 2 = 2 uses/rest, now 1 remaining)
- **Effect:** Learn target's current HD, resistances, vulnerabilities (no roll required—class ability auto-succeeds)

**Information Revealed:**

**Warden #1:**
- **Current HD:** 20d10 body (full), 2d10 armor (intact)
- **Resolve:** N/A (construct)
- **Resistances:** Stone Skin (-1 HD from incoming damage per attack, minimum 1 must penetrate)
- **Vulnerabilities:** None obvious (solid stone construction)
- **Special Mechanics:** Custodial Protocol (won't pursue beyond chamber), Immovable (+2d6 vs forced movement)

**Elara calls out:** "They have 20 body dice each, plus 2 armor dice! Stone Skin reduces incoming damage by 1—we need to hit hard or focus fire!"

**Expose Weakness (Passive Trigger):**
- **Effect:** Party's next attack against Warden #1 this scene requires 1 fewer success
- **Duration:** Remainder of scene (combat)

**Action 2: Move 10 yards** (repositioning toward pillar cover)

**Elara's turn ends.**

---

### Warden #4's Turn (Initiative 6, acts after Elara due to simultaneous resolution)

- **Rolls used:** 2/2 (capacity exhausted)

**3rd HD:**
- **No rolls remaining** → AUTO-FAIL
- **Result:** Armor depleted (1d6 → 0), move to body
- **Wait—she's out of armor layer, damage penetrates to body**
- **Result:** Body reduced (6d8 → 5d8) ← **PERMANENT DAMAGE**

> *Warden #4's stone fist crashes into Elara. Her studded leather holds for one strike, then tears apart. The third blow hits her shoulder—she cries out, stumbling.*

**Final Elara Status:**
- **Body HD:** 5d8 (down 1 die)
- **Armor:** 0 (destroyed)

- **AUTO-FAIL** → Body reduced (5d8 → 4d8) ← **PERMANENT DAMAGE**

> *Warden #3 strikes Kara with devastating force. Her shield deflects the first blow—barely—then explodes into splinters. Her scale mail crumples like parchment under the second and third strikes. The fourth hits her ribs directly. She gasps, blood on her lips.*

**Final Kara Status:**
- **Body HD:** 4d8 (down 1 die)
- **Armor:** 0 (completely destroyed)
- **Shield:** 0
- **Resolve:** 5/5

**Warden #3's turn ends.**

---

### Kara's Turn (Initiative 4)

**Current Status:** 4d8 body (down 1 die), 0 armor, 0 shield, 5/5 Resolve, Warden #3 adjacent

**Tactical Assessment:**
- Entire party has lost ALL armor
- Gareth: 7d10 body (full after Second Wind), 0 armor
- Elara: 5d8 body (down 1), 0 armor
- Kara: 4d8 body (down 1), 0 armor
- **Wardens are winning the attrition war**

**Options:**
- A) Cast Seal Minor Wound on self or ally (restore 1d6 HD + scaling)
- B) Attack Warden #3 with mace + Weapon of Faith (deal damage)
- C) Move to better position (retreat toward allies)
- D) Use Power Word: Endure on Gareth or Elara (restore 1 HD + 1 Resolve if below 5)

**Kara chooses: Option A** (Cast Seal Minor Wound on Elara—most fragile ally, only 5d8 left)

**Action 1: Cast Seal Minor Wound (Divine, Basic 2+) — Target: Elara**
- **Pool:** 1d8 (Prof 1, no exertion spent)
- **Roll:** [1d8] → 5
- **Successes:** 1 (5 clears threshold)
- **Base Healing:** 1d6 HD
- **Scaling:** No extra successes, no additional healing
- **Roll healing:** [1d6] → 4 HD restored

**HEALING MECHANICS:**
- Elara currently has 5d8 body (down 1 from max 6d8)
- Healing 4 HD restores lost dice: 5d8 + 4 HD of healing = **6d8 (fully restored body!)**

> *Kara's palm glows with warm golden light—Murien's blessing. She touches Elara's shoulder. Divine energy flows. Elara's wound knits, bruises fade.*

**Elara's Status After Healing:** 6d8 body (restored to full), 0 armor, 5/5 Resolve

**Action 2: Move 10 yards** (retreat toward archway, regroup with party)

**Kara's turn ends.**

---

## END OF ROUND 1

**Party Status:**
- **Gareth:** 7d10 body, 0 armor, 5/5 Resolve, *Second Wind USED*
- **Elara:** 6d8 body (healed), 0 armor, 5/5 Resolve, *Analyze 1/2 uses remaining*
- **Kara:** 4d8 body, 0 armor, 5/5 Resolve

**Enemy Status:**
- **Warden #1:** 20d10 body, 2d10 armor, **Expose Weakness active** (party's next attack requires -1 success)
- **Warden #2:** 20d10 body, 2d10 armor
- **Warden #3:** 20d10 body, 2d10 armor
- **Warden #4:** 20d10 body, 2d10 armor

**Tactical Analysis:**
- **Entire party unarmored** after 1 round—every future attack hits body HD directly
- **Wardens untouched**—party dealt 0 damage
- **Defense Capacity is critical**—Prof 1 (Kara) only gets 1 roll/attack, Prof 2 (Gareth/Elara) gets 2 rolls/attack
- **Party must focus fire or retreat**—cannot sustain this attrition

---

### ROUND 1

---

#### Wardens' Turn (Initiative 9)

**Tactical Assessment (Guardian Protocol):**
- **Primary Threat:** Gareth (closest to altar, violating inner sanctum radius)
- **Secondary Threats:** Elara/Kara (near exit, potential escape)

**Warden #1 (North) + Warden #2 (South):**
Both move toward Gareth (10 yards → 0 yards, closing distance). Warden #1 attacks Gareth with stone fist.

**Attack: Warden #1 vs Gareth**
- **Tier:** Basic (2+), constructs are not skilled fighters despite size
- **Required Successes:** 1
- **Warden #1 Dice Pool:** 2d10 (Prof 2) + 1d6 (exertion die for power-strike)
- **Roll:** [2d10, 1d6] → 8, 4, 3 → At threshold 2+: **3 successes**
- **Damage:** 2 HD (base) + 3 HD (exertion successes) = **5 HD total incoming**

**Gareth's Defense:**
- **Defense Pool:** 2d10 (Prof 2) + 3d8 (chain shirt armor) + 1d12 (shield)
- **Total:** 2d10 + 3d8 + 1d12 = **6 dice total**
- **Roll:** [2d10] → 4, 7 | [3d8] → 5, 2, 8 (explodes!) → reroll → 4 | [1d12] → 6
- **Results:** 4, 7, 5, 2, 8→4, 6 → Checking threshold 5+: **7, 5, 8, 6 = 4 successes**
- **Damage Cancelled:** 4 HD cancelled (one per success)
- **Damage Penetrating:** 5 HD incoming - 4 cancelled = **1 HD penetrates armor**

**Armor Depletion Check:**
- Damage penetrated = armor layer depletes
- **Chain shirt (2d8)** depleted → **GONE**
- Gareth retains shield (1d12) intact

**Gareth HD:** 48 → **47 HD** (1 damage to permanent pool, chain shirt destroyed)

**Warden #1 Exertion Burn Check:**
- Exertion die showed "3" (not a 1) → No HD burn for construct

---

**Warden #3 (East) + Warden #4 (West):**
Both move toward Elara/Kara cluster (15 yards → 0 yards, closing). Warden #3 attacks Elara (Scholar = perceived weak link, lowest armor).

**Attack: Warden #3 vs Elara**
- **Tier:** Basic (2+)
- **Required:** 1 success
- **Pool:** 2d10 (Prof 2), no exertion this attack (probing strike)
- **Roll:** [2d10] → 6, 2 → **2 successes**
- **Damage:** 2 HD base + 2 HD exertion = **4 HD incoming**

**Elara's Defense:**
- **Defense Pool:** 2d8 (Prof 2) + 2d6 (studded leather armor)
- **Total:** 4 dice
- **Roll:** [2d8] → 8 (explodes!) → reroll → 5 | [2d8 second die] → 3 | [2d6] → 4, 1
- **Results:** 8→5, 3, 4, 1 → Checking threshold 5+: **5, 5 (exploded 8 became 5+5) = 2 successes**

*(GM Note: Explosive 8 on d8 becomes reroll, got 5. That's 1 success for threshold 5+. But original 8 also counts as success. Total: 2 successes from that die.)*

**Actually, let me recalculate explosive dice properly:**
- Roll 8 on d8 → Explodes → reroll → got 5
- Total contribution from that die: 8 (original success at 5+) + reroll shows 5 (another success at 5+)
- So that's 2 cancellations from one exploding die

**Revised Defense Result:**
- Die 1 (d8): 8 (explodes) → reroll 5 → contributes 2 successes (both 5+)
- Die 2 (d8): 3 → 0 successes
- Die 3 (d6): 4 → 0 successes
- Die 4 (d6): 1 → 0 successes
- **Total: 2 successes on defense**

**Damage Resolution:**
- 4 HD incoming - 2 cancelled = **2 HD penetrates**
- Armor depletes (studded leather 2d6 **GONE**)
- Elara HD: 34 → **32 HD**

---

**Warden #4** holds position (tactical reserve, guarding altar perimeter).

---

#### Gareth's Turn (Initiative 7)

**Current Status:** 47/48 HD, 5/5 Resolve, surrounded by Wardens #1 & #2 (both within melee range), chain shirt destroyed

**Tactical Decision:**
- **Option A:** Attack Warden #1 (engage, try to drop one fast)
- **Option B:** Retreat toward Elara/Kara (defensive regroup)
- **Option C:** Use Internal Alchemy (convert resources for advantage)

**Gareth chooses:** **Option A** (Offensive—drop one guardian fast to reduce action economy pressure)

**Action:** Attack Warden #1 with longsword, spending 2 Exertion dice (Advanced tier, high commitment)

**Attack Roll:**
- **Tier:** Advanced (3+) with 2 exertion dice
- **Required:** 2 successes
- **Pool:** 2d10 (Prof 2) + 2d10 (2 exertion dice, willing to risk burn)
- **Roll:** [4d10] → 6, 10 (explodes!), 4, 2 → Explode 10 → reroll → 7
- **Results:** 6, 10→7, 4, 2 → At threshold 3+: **6, 10, 7, 4 = 4 successes**
- **Damage:** 2 HD (longsword base) + 4 HD (exertion successes) = **6 HD total**

**Exertion Burn Check:**
- Dice showed: 6, 10→7, 4, 2 → No 1s → **No burn**, Gareth keeps 47 HD

**Warden #1 Defense:**
- **Pool:** 2d10 (Prof 2, stone carapace)
- **Roll:** [2d10] → 5, 3 → **1 success** (only 5 clears threshold 5+)
- **Damage Cancelled:** 1 HD
- **Damage Taken:** 6 - 1 = **5 HD**
- **Warden #1 HD:** 30 → **25 HD**

**Descriptive Narration:**
Gareth pivots, longsword arcing toward Warden #1's torso. The blade strikes stone carapace—sparks fly—but the force is tremendous. Glowing blue veins crack beneath impact point, leaking faint light. The construct staggers back one step (damage registered).

---

#### Kara's Turn (Initiative 6)

**Current Status:** 28/28 HD, 5/5 Resolve, Warden #3 in melee range (just attacked Elara)

**Tactical Decision:**
- **Option A:** Attack Warden #3 (help Elara, reduce pressure on Scholar)
- **Option B:** Cast Seal Minor Wound on Elara (restore 1d6+ HD, defensive play)
- **Option C:** Use Power Word: Endure on Gareth (restore HD + Resolve if needed)

**Kara chooses:** **Option A** (Offensive support—Elara can't take many more hits, drop Warden #3)

**Action:** Attack Warden #3 with mace, using **Weapon of Faith** (+1d6 divine damage, burns on 1s)

**Attack Roll:**
- **Tier:** Basic (2+) (Priest weapon attacks are Basic tier via Weapon of Faith)
- **Required:** 1 success
- **Pool:** 1d8 (Prof 1) + 1d6 (Weapon of Faith bonus)
- **Roll:** [1d8, 1d6] → 5, 4 → **1 success** (only 5 clears threshold 5+)
- **Damage:** 1 HD (mace base) + 1 HD (1 success from divine die) = **2 HD total**

**Weapon of Faith Burn Check:**
- 1d6 showed "4" (not a 1) → **No burn**

**Warden #3 Defense:**
- **Pool:** 2d10 (Prof 2)
- **Roll:** [2d10] → 6, 3 → **1 success**
- **Damage Cancelled:** 1 HD
- **Damage Taken:** 2 - 1 = **1 HD**
- **Warden #3 HD:** 30 → **29 HD**

**Descriptive Narration:**
Kara swings her mace low, striking Warden #3's knee joint—the weakest structural point. The mace-head blazes with divine light (Murien's blessing channeling through the blow). Stone chips. Glowing veins flicker. Minimal damage, but the guardian's attention shifts to her.

---

#### Elara's Turn (Initiative 4)

**Current Status:** 32/34 HD, 5/5 Resolve, studded leather destroyed, Warden #3 in melee range

**Tactical Decision:**
Elara is now the most vulnerable (32 HD, no armor, two hits could drop her). She needs battlefield control.

**Option A:** Retreat 15 yards, create distance, cast Curator's Bolt from range  
**Option B:** Use Analyze ability on Warden #3 (Diagnostic mode: learn weak points, enable Expose Weakness next turn)  
**Option C:** Cast Arcane Ward on self (preemptive defense for next round)

**Elara chooses:** **Option B** (Tactical—gather intel on constructs, Expose Weakness will reduce success requirements for future attacks)

**Action:** **Analyze (Diagnostic Mode)** on Warden #3

- **Cost:** 1 use of Analyze (Prof = 2 uses/short rest, now 1 remaining)
- **Effect:** Learn target's current HD, Resolve (if applicable), resistances, vulnerabilities
- **No roll required** (class ability, auto-succeeds)

**Information Revealed:**

**Warden #3 (Awakened Construct):**
- **Current HD:** 29/30 (took 1 damage from Kara)
- **Resolve:** N/A (construct, no Resolve stat)
- **Resistances:** Physical damage from non-magical weapons (reduces incoming by 1 HD minimum)
- **Vulnerabilities:** **Glowing veins** (targeting veins specifically bypasses stone resistance, deals full damage +1 HD bonus)
- **Special:** Regeneration 3 HD/round while on temple floor (ley-powered, stops if disconnected from ground)

**Elara** (calling out): "Target the veins! Blue glow-lines are weak points—bypasses their stone armor!"

**Expose Weakness activated** (passive trigger from Analyze): Party's next attack against Warden #3 this scene requires **1 fewer success**.

---

###  END OF ROUND 1

**Party Status:**
- **Gareth:** 47/48 HD, 5/5 Resolve, chain shirt destroyed (only shield remains)
- **Elara:** 32/34 HD, 5/5 Resolve, studded leather destroyed (no armor)
- **Kara:** 28/28 HD, 5/5 Resolve, full armor intact

**Enemy Status:**
- **Warden #1:** 25/30 HD (damaged by Gareth, regenerates 3 HD start of next round → 28/30)
- **Warden #2:** 30/30 HD (undamaged, in melee with Gareth)
- **Warden #3:** 29/30 HD (damaged by Kara, **Expose Weakness active**, regenerates 3 HD → 30/30)
- **Warden #4:** 30/30 HD (holding altar perimeter, 10 yards from party)

**Tactical Situation:**
- Party is taking damage faster than dealing it (armor depleting, constructs regenerating)
- **Warden regeneration** is the critical problem—3 HD/round means party must deal 4+ HD/attack to make progress
- Expose Weakness on Warden #3 lasts "this scene"—party should focus fire
- Gareth surrounded by 2 Wardens, high risk position
- Elara exposed (no armor), primary target for next Warden attack

---

### ROUND 2

**Start of Round: Warden Regeneration**
- **Warden #1:** 25 → **28 HD** (+3 regen)
- **Warden #2:** 30 HD (full, no regen needed)
- **Warden #3:** 29 → **30 HD** (+1 to cap)
- **Warden #4:** 30 HD (full)

---

#### Wardens' Turn (Initiative 9)

**Guardian Protocol Update:**
- **Primary Threat:** Still Gareth (closest to altar)
- **Exploit Weakness:** Elara (no armor, lowest current defense)

**Warden #1:** Attacks Gareth (stone fist)
- **Pool:** 2d10, no exertion this turn
- **Roll:** [2d10] → 4, 2 → **1 success** (only 4 clears threshold 2+)
- **Damage:** 2 HD base + 1 success = **3 HD incoming**

**Gareth Defense:**
- **Pool:** 2d10 (Prof) + 1d12 (shield only, chain shirt gone)
- **Roll:** [2d10, 1d12] → 7, 3, 9 → **2 successes** (7 and 9 clear 5+)
- **Damage Cancelled:** 2 HD
- **Damage Taken:** 3 - 2 = **1 HD penetrates**
- **Shield depletes** (any penetration = outer layer gone)
- **Gareth HD:** 47 → **46 HD**, shield destroyed

Gareth now has **ZERO armor layers remaining**.

---

**Warden #2:** Attacks Gareth (blade-arm slash)
- **Pool:** 2d10 + 1d6 (exertion, attempting to finish exposed target)
- **Roll:** [2d10, 1d6] → 10 (explodes!), 5, 2 → Explode 10 → 6
- **Results:** 10→6, 5, 2 → At threshold 2+: **4 successes**
- **Damage:** 2 HD base + 4 successes = **6 HD incoming**

**Gareth Defense:**
- **Pool:** 2d10 (Proficiency only, NO ARMOR)
- **Roll:** [2d10] → 5, 8 (explodes!) → roll again → 3
- **Results:** 5, 8→3 → Check threshold 5+: **5 (yes), 8 (yes), 3 (no) = 2 successes**
- **Damage Cancelled:** 2 HD
- **Damage Taken:** 6 - 2 = **4 HD to permanent pool**
- **Gareth HD:** 46 → **42 HD**

**Gareth gasps**—blade-arm carves across his shoulder, drawing blood. Stone grinds against bone. He's taking real damage now.

**Warden #2 Exertion Burn:**
- 1d6 showed "2" (not 1) → No burn to construct

---

**Warden #3:** Attacks Elara (attempting kill on weakest target)
- **Pool:** 2d10 + 2d6 (2 exertion dice, full commitment)
- **Roll:** [2d10, 2d6] → 7, 4, 5, 1
- **Results at threshold 2+:** **4 successes** (all but 1 clear)
- **Damage:** 2 HD base + 4 successes = **6 HD incoming**

**Elara Defense:**
- **Pool:** 2d8 (Prof 2, NO ARMOR)
- **Roll:** [2d8] → 6, 2 → **1 success** (only 6 clears 5+)
- **Damage Cancelled:** 1 HD
- **Damage Taken:** 6 - 1 = **5 HD to permanent pool**
- **Elara HD:** 32 → **27 HD**

**Elara cries out**—stone fist catches her ribs, lifting her off feet, slamming her into chamber wall. She hits ground hard, gasping.

**Warden #3 Exertion Burn:**
- 2d6 showed "5, 1" → **One die burned!**
- Constructs don't have permanent HD pools (they're sustained by ley energy)
- **Warden #3:** No mechanical burn effect (constructs immune to exertion burn—powered eternally by temple)

---

**Warden #4:** Moves forward (30 yards → closes to 15 yards from party, supporting #3/#1/#2)

---

#### Gareth's Turn (Initiative 7)

**Current Status:** 42/48 HD (took 6 damage total this round), 5/5 Resolve, NO ARMOR, surrounded

**Critical Decision Point:**
Gareth is losing armor economy, taking permanent HD damage, and surrounded. Party is being overwhelmed.

**Options:**
- **A:** Continue offense (try to drop Warden #1, deal 28+ damage in one hit—unlikely)
- **B:** Use Internal Alchemy (convert 1 Resolve → restore 2 HD, minimal gain)
- **C:** Use **Deny Death** ability (when dropping to 0 HD, spend 2 Resolve → remain at Prof HD)—but he's not at 0 yet
- **D:** **Tactical Retreat** toward Elara/Kara, regroup, focus fire on one Warden

**Gareth chooses:** **Option D** (Regroup—isolated combatant dies, concentrated force survives)

**Action:**Move 20 yards back toward archway (breaking melee with Wardens #1/#2), position beside Kara/Elara

**Wardens #1/#2 don't get opportunity attacks** (Affinity system doesn't have that mechanic unless specified by abilities)

**Gareth** (panting, bleeding): "Focus fire! We can't out-damage their regeneration spread across four targets!"

---

#### Kara's Turn (Initiative 6)

**Current Status:** 28/28 HD, 5/5 Resolve, full armor, Warden #3 in melee

**Tactical Assessment:**
- Gareth took 6 HD damage (needs healing, but not critical yet—42/48 = 87% health)
- Elara took 5 HD damage (27/34 = 79% health, more vulnerable)
- Party needs to **drop one Warden** to reduce incoming damage/round

**Options:**
- **A:** Cast Seal Minor Wound on Elara (restore 1d6+ HD, defensive)
- **B:** Use Power Word: Endure on Gareth (restore 1 HD + 1 Resolve if below 5)
- **C:** Attack Warden #3 with full commitment (try to finish it while Expose Weakness is active)

**Kara chooses:** **Option C** (Offense—Warden #3 has Expose Weakness active, party gets -1 required success, best chance to drop one)

**Action:** Attack Warden #3, using **Weapon of Faith** (+2d6 divine since #3 opposes Murien's nature—constructs vs. creation goddess)

**Attack Roll:**
- **Tier:** Basic (2+), but **Expose Weakness** reduces required successes by 1 → Requires **0 successes** (auto-hit if any success)
- **Pool:** 1d8 (Prof 1) + 2d6 (Weapon of Faith vs opposed target)
- **Roll:** [1d8, 2d6] → 6, 5, 2 → **3 successes** (6, 5, 2 all clear threshold 2+... wait, Basic is 2+, so 2 also clears)
- **Damage:** 1 HD (mace) + 3 HD (3 successes) = **4 HD total**

**Weapon of Faith Burn Check:**
- 2d6 showed "5, 2" (no 1s) → **No burn**

**Warden #3 Defense:**
- **Pool:** 2d10 (Prof 2)
- **Roll:** [2d10] → 9, 4 → **1 success** (only 9 clears 5+)
- **Damage Cancelled:** 1 HD
- **Damage Taken:** 4 - 1 = **3 HD**
- **Warden #3 HD:** 30 → **27 HD**

**Kara's blow connects—mace strike targeting exposed vein cluster Elara identified. Blue light flickers violently. Progress.**

---

#### Elara's Turn (Initiative 4)

**Current Status:** 27/34 HD (hurt), 5/5 Resolve, no armor, tactical positioning

**Options:**
- **A:** Cast Curator's Bolt at Warden #3 (finish it—force damage can't be resisted, guaranteed hit)
- **B:** Retreat fully through archway (disengage, reset)
- **C:** Use **Tactical Projection** ability (grant ally +1d6 on next attack vs analyzed target)

**Elara chooses:** **Option A** (Finish Warden #3—it's at 27 HD, regenerates 3 next round to 30, need to kill it NOW)

**Action:** Cast **Curator's Bolt** (Basic 2+, Arcane domain, force damage)

**Casting Roll:**
- **Tier:** Basic (2+), Required: 1 success
- **Pool:** 2d8 (Prof 2) + exertion dice (Elara commits 1d8 exertion die)
- **Total:** 3d8
- **Roll:** [3d8] → 7, 5, 3 → **2 successes** (7 and 5 clear threshold 5+... wait, Basic tier is 2+, so all three clear: **3 successes**)

Wait, I need to clarify thresholds:
- **Basic tier = 2+** means you need to roll threshold 2+ on the INITIAL roll, then count how many dice show 5+ for successes.

Let me re-read the rules... Actually, looking at the spell description:
- "Curator's Bolt - Tier: Basic (2+), Required: 1"
- This means: Tier determines DIFFICULTY of the roll (what counts as success on each die)
- "Required" is how many successes you NEED for the spell to work

So for Basic tier spells:
- Each die that shows **2 or higher** on a d6 (or equivalent threshold on other dice) counts as... no wait.

Let me check the core mechanics again. The threshold system works like this:
- **Basic (2+)**: You need the action to be "Basic difficulty" which requires achieving a threshold
- Individual dice show results, and results of 5+ count as "successes"
- The TIER (Basic/Advanced/Expert/Legendary) determines the base required successes

Actually, re-reading Affinity_Core_Mechanics, the tier system is:
- **Tier** determines DIFFICULTY (how hard the action is)
- **Proficiency + Exertion dice** are rolled
- **Threshold** is always 5+ on individual dice for "success"
- **Required successes** = tier difficulty:
  - Basic = 1 success needed
  - Advanced = 2 successes needed
  - Expert = 3+ successes needed

So Elara's Curator's Bolt:
- **Roll:** [3d8] → 7, 5, 3
- **Threshold check (5+ on each die):** 7 ✓, 5 ✓, 3 ✗
- **Successes:** 2
- **Required:** 1 (Basic tier)
- **Result:** SUCCESS with 1 extra success

**Damage:** 1 HD (base) + 2 HD (2 total successes) = **3 HD force damage**

**Elara Exertion Burn Check:**
- 1d8 (exertion die) showed "3" (not a 1) → **No burn**

**Warden #3 Defense:**
- **Force damage cannot be defended** (Curator's Bolt special: "cannot be resisted")
- **Warden #3 takes full 3 HD**
- **Warden #3 HD:** 27 → **24 HD**

**Elara** (hand outstretched, obsidian pendant glowing): "*Curator's judgment!*"

Three bolts of pure force—reality-warping energy—lance from her hand, striking Warden #3's torso. Glowing veins **shatter** along impact lines. Stone cracks audibly. The construct staggers.

---

### END OF ROUND 2

**Party Status:**
- **Gareth:** 42/48 HD, 5/5 Resolve, no armor, repositioned near allies
- **Elara:** 27/34 HD, 5/5 Resolve, no armor
- **Kara:** 28/28 HD, 5/5 Resolve, full armor (2d8 + 1d12)

**Enemy Status (Before Regeneration):**
- **Warden #1:** 28/30 HD (damaged, near full)
- **Warden #2:** 30/30 HD (undamaged)
- **Warden #3:** 24/30 HD (damaged, but regen will restore 3 → 27 HD next round)
- **Warden #4:** 30/30 HD (advancing, 15 yards from party)

**Critical Problem:**
Party is dealing 3-6 HD/attack, but Wardens regenerate 3 HD/round. Net progress: 0-3 HD/round per target. With 4 Wardens active, party cannot win attrition war.

**Tactical Options:**
1. **Focus Fire** one Warden to death (requires 24+ damage in single round before regen—   possible if all three attack same target?)
2. **Retreat through archway** (Durg said Wardens stop at threshold—territorial boundary)
3. **Target altar/ley connection** (disable regeneration source, but requires successful Lore/Weave check + action economy)

**Next round will be critical—party must adapt or retreat.**

---

## 🛡️ ROUND 3: TACTICAL RETREAT

**⚠️ GM NOTE:** The party recognizes the math doesn't work—3 HD regeneration/round per Warden means they're dealing net-zero damage against four targets. Time to regroup and find another approach.

---

### Initiative Order (Round 3):
1. Warden #1 (Init 15)
2. Warden #2 (Init 14)  
3. **Gareth** (Init 13) ← **Calls the retreat**
4. **Elara** (Init 12)
5. Warden #4 (Init 11)
6. Warden #3 (Init 9)
7. **Kara** (Init 8)

---

### Warden #1 Regeneration Phase
**Ley-Empowered:** Automatic 3 HD restoration  
**Warden #1:** 28 HD → **30 HD (full health)**

The cracks in Warden #1's stone carapace seal shut with grinding finality. Blue runes pulse brighter.

---

### Warden #2 Regeneration Phase
**Already at full health:** 30/30 HD (no change)

---

### Warden #1's Turn
**Target:** Gareth (20 yards away, unarmored, visible threat)  
**Action:** Advance 20 yards + Stone Fist attack

**Stone Fist Attack:**
- **Dice Pool:** 3d6 proficiency + relevant exertion
- **Target Tier:** Moderate (3+, Gareth unarmored = reduced difficulty)
- **Roll:** [3d6] → **5, 6, 4**
- **Threshold 5+ successes:** 5 ✓, 6 ✓✓ (explosive = 2), 4 ✗ → **3 successes**
- **Result:** SUCCESS (1 required for Basic attack, 2 extra successes)
- **Damage:** 3 HD base + Stone Skin enhancement

**Gareth Defense Sequence:**

**Defense Capacity:** 2 rolls per attack (Proficiency 2)  
**Defense Layer:** 7d10 body HD (NO armor remaining)  
**Incoming Damage:** 3 HD

**1st HD of damage:**
- **Defense Roll:** 1d10 body → **4** ❌ FAIL (5+ required)
- **Result:** Lose 1 body die (7d10 → 6d10)

**2nd HD of damage:**
- **Defense Roll:** 1d10 body → **7** ✅ SUCCESS
- **Result:** Sustain (6d10 remains)

**3rd HD of damage:**
- **No defense rolls remaining** (used 2/2 capacity)
- **Auto-fail:** Lose 1 body die (6d10 → 5d10)

**Gareth Status:** 5d10 body (approximately **33 HD remaining from original 48**)

The stone fist **slams** into Gareth's ribs. No armor. Just flesh and bone against ancient construct strength. He feels ribs crack, breath explode from lungs. Blood on his tongue.

---

### Warden #2's Turn
**Target:** Gareth (killing blow attempted)  
**Action:** Advance + Stone Fist

**Stone Fist Attack:**
- **Roll:** [3d6] → **6, 5, 2**
- **Successes:** 6 ✓✓, 5 ✓, 2 ✗ → **3 successes**
- **Damage:** 3 HD

**Gareth Defense Sequence (FRESH CAPACITY - new attack):**

**1st HD:**
- **Roll:** 1d10 → **6** ✅ SUSTAIN

**2nd HD:**
- **Roll:** 1d10 → **3** ❌ FAIL (5d10 → 4d10)

**3rd HD:**
- **Auto-fail:** (4d10 → 3d10)

**Gareth Status:** 3d10 body (**~21 HD remaining**, critically wounded)

The second Warden's fist catches Gareth across the shoulder. Bone **snaps**. He staggers, vision blurring, blood soaking his tunic. One more hit and he's dead.

---

### GARETH'S TURN - TACTICAL COMMAND

**Gareth** (coughing blood, one arm hanging useless): "*We can't win this! Fall back to the archway—NOW!*"

**Action 1:** Call tactical retreat (Leadership - free action, establishes plan)  
**Action 2:** Fighting Retreat (Disengage + move 30 yards toward exit)

**Disengage Mechanic:**
- **Gareth uses full action to withdraw defensively** (no attacks of opportunity from Wardens)
- **Movement:** 30 yards toward chamber entrance (must reach 60-yard archway threshold)

**Gareth** staggers backward, shield-arm raised defensively despite having no shield, blood dripping from mouth. His voice cracks but holds authority: "*Elara! Kara! With me! We need information, not a corpse pile!*"

---

### ELARA'S TURN - COVERING FIRE & RETREAT

**Elara** recognizes the logic immediately. Four regenerating constructs. No armor. Attrition math is fatal.

**Action 1:** Curator's Bolt (ranged attack on Warden #1, buying time)  
**Action 2:** Retreat 30 yards (following Gareth)

**Curator's Bolt vs Warden #1:**
- **Roll:** [3d8] → **6, 5, 1**
- **Successes:** 6 ✓✓, 5 ✓, 1 ✗ → **3 successes**
- **Damage:** 3 HD (force, undefendable)
- **Warden #1:** 30 HD → **27 HD**
- **Exertion Burn Check:** 1d8 → **1** ❌ **BURN 1 HD**

**Elara Status:** 6d8 body → **5d8 body** (~24 HD remaining)

Three bolts of force **slam** into Warden #1's chest, spider-webbing cracks across stone. It staggers but does not fall. Elara feels the Curator's power tear through her—price paid. She gasps, clutches her side, and **runs**.

**Movement:** 30 yards toward exit (now 30 yards behind Gareth)

---

### Warden #4's Turn
**Target:** Kara (still 20 yards away, unarmored, easy target)  
**Action:** Advance + Stone Fist

**Stone Fist Attack:**
- **Roll:** [3d6] → **5, 4, 3**
- **Successes:** 5 ✓, 4 ✗, 3 ✗ → **1 success**
- **Damage:** 3 HD (base Stone Fist damage)

**Kara Defense Sequence:**

**Defense Capacity:** 1 roll per attack (Proficiency 1)  
**Defense Layer:** 2d8 armor + 1d12 shield + 4d8 body

**1st HD:**
- **Roll:** 1d12 shield → **9** ✅ SUSTAIN (shield remains 1d12)

**2nd HD:**
- **No rolls remaining** (used 1/1 capacity)
- **Auto-fail:** Lose shield (1d12 → 0)

**3rd HD:**
- **Auto-fail:** Lose armor (2d8 → 1d8)

**Kara Status:** 4d8 body + 1d8 armor + 0 shield

The Warden's fist **crashes** through Kara's shield, shattering the wooden frame. Her scale mail buckles, a pauldron tearing free. She cries out, stumbles.

---

### Warden #3 Regeneration + Turn
**Regeneration:** 24 HD → **27 HD** (cracks sealing from Elara's earlier bolt)

**Target:** Kara (close, vulnerable)  
**Action:** Advance + Stone Fist

**Stone Fist Attack:**
- **Roll:** [3d6] → **6, 5, 5**
- **Successes:** 6 ✓✓, 5 ✓, 5 ✓ → **4 successes** (devastating hit)
- **Damage:** 3 HD + enhanced impact

**Kara Defense (fresh capacity):**

**1st HD:**
- **Roll:** 1d8 armor → **3** ❌ FAIL (armor destroyed 1d8 → 0)

**2nd HD:**
- **No rolls remaining**
- **Auto-fail:** Body 4d8 → 3d8

**3rd HD:**
- **Auto-fail:** Body 3d8 → 2d8

**Kara Status:** 2d8 body (~12 HD remaining, **CRITICAL**)

The second blow **crushes** Kara's remaining armor. Metal screeches. She feels ribs crack, breath stolen. Blood spatters stone. Vision darkening.

---

### KARA'S TURN - DESPERATE RETREAT

**Kara** (gasping, barely standing): "*Murien preserve us—*"

**Action 1:** Seal Minor Wound (SELF-CAST, emergency healing)  
**Action 2:** Retreat 30 yards

**Seal Minor Wound (Self):**
- **Healing:** 1d6 → **4**
- **Kara:** 2d8 → restore 4 HD → **2d8 (full 16 HD)**

Kara's prayer blazes golden. Wounds seal. Ribs snap back into place with agonizing pops. She screams through clenched teeth, then **runs**.

**Movement:** 30 yards toward exit (catching up to Elara)

---

### WARDENS PURSUE - BUT STOP AT THRESHOLD

All four Wardens advance toward the fleeing party. Stone feet thunder. Runes flare.

**Warden Movement:** Each advances 30 yards toward archway

**Distance Check:**
- **Archway Threshold:** 60 yards from ley-node center
- **Gareth Position:** 60 yards (REACHES ARCHWAY)
- **Elara Position:** 60 yards (REACHES ARCHWAY)
- **Kara Position:** 50 yards (10 yards short, still in chamber)
- **Wardens:** 40-50 yards (closing fast)

**CUSTODIAL PROTOCOL ACTIVATES:**

As Gareth crosses the archway threshold back into the connecting hallway:

> The pursuing Wardens **STOP**. All four, simultaneously, as if striking invisible walls. Runes dim from blazing blue to soft glow. They do not speak. They do not gesture. They simply... **stop**. Stone guardians at the boundary of their sacred charge.
>
> One raises a hand—palm out. **STOP.** Same gesture from the Antechamber. Warning, not threat.
>
> They will not pursue beyond the chamber. Territorial. Programmed. Absolute.

**Kara** (still 10 yards inside chamber, limping): Sees the Wardens stop, seizes the moment, sprints the final distance. Crosses threshold. Safe.

---

### END OF ROUND 3 - RETREAT SUCCESSFUL

**Party Status (At Hallway Junction, 60 Yards from Ley-Node Chamber):**

- **Gareth Thornwood (Sovereign 3):**
  - **HD:** 3d10 body (~21/48 HD remaining, **44% health**)
  - **Armor:** 0 (all destroyed)
  - **Resolve:** 5/5
  - **Condition:** Critically wounded (broken ribs, shattered shoulder, internal bleeding)

  - **HD:** 5d8 body (~24/34 HD remaining, **71% health**)
  - **Armor:** 0 (all destroyed)
  - **Resolve:** 5/5
  - **Condition:** Wounded (exertion burn, cuts, bruised)

  - **HD:** 2d8 body (16/28 HD remaining, **57% health**)
  - **Armor:** 0 (shield + scale mail destroyed)
  - **Resolve:** 5/5
  - **Condition:** Wounded (healed ribs still aching, armor lost)
  - **Spells Used:** Seal Minor Wound ×2 (on Elara + self)

- **Warden #2:** 30/30 HD
- **Warden #3:** 27/30 HD
- **Warden #4:** 30/30 HD

All four stand motionless at the archway, glowing faintly, watching. Waiting.

---

## 📜 SCENE 4: REGROUPING & INVESTIGATION

**Location:** Hallway junction, 100 yards from Ritual Chamber hub

The party collapses against the stone walls, gasping, bleeding. Silence except for ragged breathing and distant grinding of stone.

**Gareth** (clutching broken shoulder): "*We can't fight them head-on. Four constructs, regenerating faster than we can damage them. We need... information. A weakness. Something.*"

**Elara** (wiping blood from split lip, Scholar instincts kicking in): "*The Archive. Durg's map showed branching paths—this can't be the only chamber. If this is a temple, there must be records. Tablets. Ritual instructions.*"

**Kara** (praying quietly, binding wounds with torn cloth): "*Sacred places follow patterns. Central worship chamber, archive for knowledge, guardian sanctum, and... the heart. We rushed to the heart without understanding.*"

**Tactical Assessment:**

The party recognizes several critical facts:
1. **Cannot win direct combat** (4 vs 3, regeneration negates damage)
2. **Wardens are territorial** (won't pursue beyond chamber—exploitable)
3. **This is a temple complex** (must have other rooms with information)
4. **They're missing context** (what IS this place? Why are constructs active? How to stop them?)

**Group Decision:** Retreat to safer area, explore temple systematically, find lore/rituals that explain how to properly approach the guardians or disable them.

---

## 🗺️ SCENE 5: DISCOVERING THE RITUAL CHAMBER

**Backtracking through hallways** (30 minutes of cautious movement, treating wounds, checking for traps):

The party retraces steps through the blue-flamed corridor, past the collapsed section they bypassed earlier, until they reach... something they missed in their initial rush.

**Read Aloud:**

> The hallway opens into a **circular chamber**—60 feet across, domed ceiling carved with spiraling patterns. At the center: a raised stone dais with an altar. The altar's surface depicts a mountain swallowing a serpent, edges worn smooth by centuries.
>
> Around the altar: **seven stone pedestals**, each bearing a carved bowl. The bowls are empty, dust-filled.
>
> Three archways lead from this chamber:
> - **North**: Sealed by stone portcullis (the Guardian Vault path they bypassed)
> - **East**: Sealed by stone portcullis (**UNOPENED** - Archive Chamber)
> - **West**: Open archway (the path they took to ley-node chamber)
>
> The hum beneath the floor is softer here—rhythmic, steady. Like a heartbeat. The ley-node's pulse, distant but present.

**Elara Investigation Check:**

**Investigation (Scholar specialty):**
- **Roll:** [4d6 proficiency + 1d6 Scholar bonus] = 5d6 → **6, 5, 5, 3, 2**
- **Successes:** 6 ✓✓, 5 ✓, 5 ✓, 3 ✗, 2 ✗ → **4 successes** (Expert-tier insight)

**What Elara Discovers:**

1. **The pedestals are a puzzle** - Weight-balanced locks for the portcullises
2. **Scattered stones** (21 total) of varying weights (1-5 lbs) lie around chamber edges
3. **The East gate** (Archive) requires **10 lbs total** to open (inscription barely visible: "Knowledge weighs as two hands upon stone")
4. **This is the TEMPLE HUB** - all paths radiate from here

**Elara** (running hands over altar): "*We missed this completely. We saw the western path open and just... charged in. This is a central worship hall. The other paths were sealed for a reason—meant to be opened deliberately, with understanding.*"

**Gareth** (grimacing, holding ribs): "*The Archive. East path. If anywhere has answers, it's there.*"

**Kara** (kneeling at altar, brushing away dust): "*This altar... I can feel residual divinity. Faint. Old. Whoever was worshipped here, they valued... foundation. Stability. Order.*" (Religion check: Moderate success)

---

## 🔓 PUZZLE: Opening the East Gate (Archive Chamber)

**Challenge:** Place stones totaling exactly 10 lbs in the pedestals to open East portcullis

**Available Stones (scattered around chamber):**
- Six 1-lb stones
- Four 2-lb stones  
- Three 3-lb stones
- Two 5-lb stones

**Solution (multiple valid combinations):**
- 5 + 5 = 10
- 5 + 3 + 2 = 10
- 5 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 10
- 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 10
- etc.

**Elara's Turn:**

The Scholar collects stones, weighing them by hand (years of academic work = good weight estimation), and places:
- One 5-lb stone (dark granite, smooth)
- One 3-lb stone (marble, veined)
- One 2-lb stone (basalt, dense)

**Total:** 10 lbs exactly

The altar **hums**. Blue runes trace along the dais edge, flowing toward the East archway. The stone portcullis **grinds upward**, revealing a dark corridor beyond.

**Kara** (whispering prayer): "*Murien, guide our search. Let knowledge light our path.*"

---

## 📚 SCENE 6: THE ARCHIVE CHAMBER

**Hallway (East Path):** 80 feet long, lined with alcoves containing stone tablets (hundreds of them, library-like shelving carved into walls)

**Trap Warning:**

**Elara Awareness Check (automatic, Scholar specialty):**
- **Roll:** [4d6] → **6, 5, 4, 2** → **3 successes** (Moderate success)

**Discovery:** Floor tiles are pressure-sensitive. Stepping wrong = dart traps from wall alcoves.

**Elara** (raising hand, halting party): "*Wait. See those seams? Pressure plates. Classic archive protection—keep looters from running through.*"

**Gareth** (defensive stance): "*Can you disable it?*"

**Elara Trap Disarm (Investigation + Agility):**
- **Roll:** [5d6] → **6, 6, 5, 3, 1** → **5 successes** (Expert success)

**Result:** Elara identifies safe path (specific tile pattern: step only on tiles with faint central dots, avoid smooth tiles). Party navigates safely.

---

### The Archive Proper

> The corridor ends at a circular chamber, 40 feet across. Every inch of wall from floor to 20-foot ceiling: **stone tablets**. Hundreds. Thousands. Each carved with dense text in geometric script.
>
> At the chamber's center: a stone lectern bearing a large tablet—title plate, index, or dedication.
>
> The air is perfectly still. No dust (magical preservation). No decay. This knowledge has waited centuries, untouched.

**Elara** (barely breathing, Scholar's dream realized): "*By the Curator's eyes... this is an entire civilization's recorded history.*"

---

### Translation Challenge

The tablets are in **Old Terran** (pre-Sowing language, 800+ years extinct).

**Elara Lore Check (Scholar specialty - ancient languages):**
- **Roll:** [4d6 + 1d6 Curator's Insight] = 5d6 → **6, 5, 5, 4, 3**
- **Successes:** 6 ✓✓, 5 ✓, 5 ✓, 4 ✗, 3 ✗ → **4 successes** (Expert-tier translation)

**What Elara Reads (Central Lectern Tablet):**

> **"Resonance Temple of Khuldras, the Deep Foundation"**
>
> *Here rests the sacred archive of the Stoneheart Clans, faithful servants of Khuldras—Lesser Deity of Earth, Stability, Hidden Truths, and Unshakable Foundation.*
>
> *This temple stands upon a ley-node of profound power. Through ritual and divine blessing, we have *bound the node's chaos, stabilizing the land for fifty leagues. Our mines are safe. Our mountains stand firm. Our foundations endure.*
>
> *When we fade (as all mortals must), the Sentinel Guardians shall keep vigil eternal. They know not malice. Only duty. Only protection.*
>
> **WARNING TO FUTURE SEEKERS:**
>
> *Break not the seals without divine authority. Disturb not the ley-node without understanding. Stone remembers. Stone endures. Stone does not forgive ignorance.*

**Elara** (voice shaking): "*We broke the seals. We didn't know. The Wardens aren't malfunctioning—they're doing exactly what they were built to do. Protecting the temple from... us.*"

---

### Critical Tablets - The Ritual of Foundation

**Elara searches frantically** (30 minutes of reading, cross-referencing, Scholar training in full effect):

**Key Tablets Found:**

**1. "On the Nature of Ley-Nodes":**
> *Ley-nodes are convergences of the Weave's raw power. Unstable by nature. Left unchecked, they warp reality, shatter stone, birth aberrations. The Stoneheart Clans discovered: ley-nodes can be STABILIZED through divine ritual, anchoring chaos to order.*

**2. "The Sentinel Guardians - Custodial Constructs":**
> *Our Guardians are stone given purpose. Powered by the ley-node itself. They regenerate while within the node's influence. They cannot be bargained with. They cannot be bribed. To pass them, one must:*
> - *Prove divine authority (holy symbol, ritual gesture, priestly blessing)*
> - *Offer tribute at the altar (symbolic acknowledgment)*
> - *Speak the Custodian's Oath ("I walk these halls with respect, not greed")*

**3. "Ritual of Foundation - Ley-Node Stabilization":**
> *When the ley-node destabilizes (earthquake, breach, seal-breaking), perform this ritual to restore balance:*
>
> **Requirements:**
> - Divine caster (Priest, Paladin, or deity's chosen)
> - Three consecrated candles (blessed by earth deity)
> - Stone from the node chamber
> - Spoken prayer acknowledging Khuldras's domain
>
> **Process:**
> 1. Place candles in triangular pattern around ley-node
> 2. Light candles with divine flame (Sacred Flame spell or blessed fire)
> 3. Touch node with blessed stone
> 4. Recite: *"Foundation beneath, stability above, chaos to order, Khuldras's love"*
> 5. Channel divine energy (Religion check, Expert 4+ difficulty)
>
> **Success:** Ley-node stabilizes. Earthquakes cease. Guardians return to dormancy.

**Elara** (clutching tablet, hands trembling): "*I found it. The ritual. We can stabilize the node without fighting them. But we need...*" (reads list) "*...divine caster, consecrated candles, and we have to get close to the node again.*"

**Kara** (stepping forward): "*I'm the divine caster. Murien isn't Khuldras, but the prayer acknowledges another deity—I can channel that. And Sister Marla's blessing gave us...*" (checks belt pouch) "*...wait.*"

**Gareth** (remembering): "*Chandle. The merchant. They gave us something before we descended—said to leave it as offering on the altar when we found it.*"

**Inventory Check:**

Party searches packs. **Gareth unwraps** the small package Chandle pressed into his hands back in Stonebridge:

> Three candles. Not ordinary wax—crystalline, faintly glowing, inscribed with geometric patterns. A note (Chandle's flowing script):
>
> *"For the altar of the Deep Foundation. Light these in the presence of chaos, and order shall remember itself. You're welcome. —C"*

**Elara** (laughing despite exhaustion): "*That mysterious bastard KNEW. They knew exactly what we'd find down here.*"

**Kara** (taking candles reverently): "*Consecrated by... someone powerful. These will work.*"

---

## 🛠️ SCENE 7: PREPARING THE RITUAL

**Location:** Archive Chamber (party resting, planning)

**Resources Gathered:**
- ✅ **Consecrated candles** (Chandle's gift)
- ✅ **Divine caster** (Kara, Priest of Murien)
- ✅ **Ritual instructions** (Elara translated from tablets)
- ⏸️ **Stone from node chamber** (must retrieve when returning)

**Tactical Planning:**

**Gareth** (strategic mind engaged): "*We can't fight our way back to the node. Four Wardens, regenerating. But we know they stop at the threshold. So...*"

**Elara** (following logic): "*We approach differently. Not as invaders. As... petitioners.*"

**Kara** (reading ritual tablet over Elara's shoulder): "*The instructions mention 'Custodian's Oath.' If we speak it before entering, show respect, offer tribute at the altar...*"

**Gareth**: "*The Wardens might stand down. Or at least not attack on sight.*"

**Party Plan:**
1. **Rest and heal** (Short Rest in Archive - safe location)
2. **Prepare ritual components** (candles, prayers, mental preparation)
3. **Return to Ritual Chamber** (central hub)
4. **Offer tribute at altar** (symbolic gesture - Kara's holy symbol of Murien, acknowledging Khuldras)
5. **Approach ley-node chamber speaking Custodian's Oath**
6. **Perform Ritual of Foundation** (Kara casts, party defends if needed)

**Elara** (worried): "*If the Wardens don't accept the Oath... we fight again. And we barely survived last time.*"

**Gareth** (checking wounds, grimacing): "*Then we make sure they accept it. Kara leads. I follow. Elara provides Lore support. We show humility, not bravado.*"

---

## ⏸️ SHORT REST - HEALING & RECOVERY

**Short Rest Mechanics:**
- Party rests for 1 hour in Archive Chamber (safe, no encounters)
- Each PC can roll HD to recover (spending existing HD dice for healing)
- Resolve remains intact (no Resolve lost this encounter)

**Gareth** (spending HD for recovery):
- Current: 3d10 (~21 HD)
- Spends 2d10 for healing: Roll [2d10] → 7 + 9 = 16 HD recovered
- New total: 5d10 (~37 HD, **77% health**)
- Still missing armor, ribs taped with bandages

**Elara** (spending HD):
- Current: 5d8 (~24 HD)
- Spends 1d8: Roll [1d8] → 6 HD recovered
- New total: 6d8 (~30 HD, **88% health**)

**Kara** (spending HD):
- Current: 2d8 (~16 HD)
- Spends 1d8: Roll [1d8] → 5 HD recovered
- New total: 3d8 (~21 HD, **75% health**)

**Party Status (After Rest):**
- Wounded but functional
- No armor (all destroyed in combat)
- Resolve intact (5/5 each)
- Ritual components ready
- Knowledge obtained (critical success)

---

## 📜 END OF SESSION 2 (INVESTIGATION PHASE)

**Session Summary:**

**Combat Encounter:**
