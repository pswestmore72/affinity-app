# The Hollow Below - Session 2 Playtest Log

**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Campaign:** The Hollow Below  
**Session:** 2 - The Awakened Warden  
**Party Level:** 2  
**Expected Duration:** 2 hours (simulated)  
**Focus:** COMBAT MECHANICS TESTING

**⚠️ CORRECTED VERSION - February 16, 2026:**
This session log has been **completely rewritten** using correct defense mechanics after a fundamental error was discovered in the original simulation. See [DEFENSE_MECHANICS_CORRECTION.md](DEFENSE_MECHANICS_CORRECTION.md) for full details.

**Key Corrections:**
- Defense = Armor = Hit Dice (unified pool)
- Defense Capacity = rolls PER ATTACK (not per round)
- Damage resolved DIE-BY-DIE (sequential, 1 HD at a time)
- Each failed roll removes ONE die from layer (not entire layer)
- Warden stats corrected: 50 HD → 20 HD, Stone Skin -2 → -1

## Recap: Session 1 Ending

The party stands at the threshold of the inner sanctum. Through the great basalt door—now unlocked thanks to Lyra's puzzle-solving—they see:

> *The ley-node chamber stretches before you. Thirty yards across, circular, with pillars of dark stone rising to a domed ceiling covered in geometric carvings. In the center, a shaft of crackling blue-white energy descends from the apex into a dark pit—the ley-node itself, unstable and pulsing.*
>
> *The ground trembles with each pulse. Dust falls from cracks in the ceiling.*
>
> *And between you and the ley-node stands the Awakened Warden.*
>
> *Ten feet tall. Carved from black basalt streaked with blue runes that pulse in rhythm with the ley-node. It turns slowly toward the opening door. Stone grinds against stone. Its blank face has no eyes, but you KNOW it sees you.*
>
> *It raises one massive hand. Palm out. Stop.*

---

## Scene 1: The Warden's Warning

### Narrative

The Awakened Warden doesn't immediately attack. It follows Custodial Protocol:

> *The Warden's runes pulse brighter blue. It takes one thundering step forward and gestures:*
>
> **Raised palm → Closed fist → Points at the ley-node → Shakes head.**
>
> *Translation: "Stop. Don't touch that."*
>
> *Another gesture: Points at party → Points at door behind them → Open palm (peaceful).*
>
> *Translation: "Leave now. No harm."*

**Party Decision Point:**

The party must choose:
1. **Negotiate/diplomacy** — Demonstrate divine authority or religious intent
2. **Retreat** — Leave and seek another solution
3. **Attack** — Combat begins
4. **Use Kara's offering stone** — Show respect to Khuldras

---

### Party Response: Using Kara's Offering Stone

**Lyra:** "Wait—we're not here to desecrate. We're here to HELP." *(She reaches into her satchel, pulls out Kara's carved offering stone.)*

**Torvan:** *(Steps forward, places hand on Lyra's shoulder protectively.)* "Let her try. Ready weapons if it goes wrong."

**Kael:** *(Nocks arrow but doesn't draw. Eyes on the Warden, reading its movements.)*

> *Lyra steps forward slowly, offering stone held before her. The Warden's runes pulse—confusion? Recognition?*
>
> *She sets the stone on the ground, then steps back.*

**Influence Check (Moderate 3+)** — Demonstrating peaceful intent

**Lyra rolls:** 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Exertion, she's willing to push) = 2d6
- **Roll:** [4, 2] = 1 success (threshold 3+)
- **Exertion result:** No 1s — no HD burn

**Failure.** The Warden processes... but 1 success isn't enough.

> *The Warden tilts its head. Runes flicker. It reaches down and picks up the offering stone—cradles it almost gently—then sets it aside.*
>
> *But it doesn't step aside. The ley-node pulses wildly behind it.*
>
> *The Warden points at the ley-node, then makes a new gesture: Hands together, then apart (breaking). Shake head.*
>
> *Translation: "The node is breaking. I cannot let you touch it."*
>
> *Its programming is clear: Protect the node. Even if protecting means stopping repairs.*

**The Warden isn't hostile, but it won't move.** 

The party recognizes: They'll need to either defeat it, find a way to override its programming, or... something creative.

---

### Lyra's Insight

**Lyra:** "Wait. Its programming is to PROTECT the ley-node. But the ley-node is already destabilized. If we can show we're trying to HELP—"

**Kael:** "It's a construct. It follows rules, not intent."

**Lyra:** "Then we give it new rules. The inscriptions on the pillars—there must be command protocols!"

**Lore Check (Advanced 3+, 2 required)** — Recalling ancient Khuldras temple protocols

**Lyra rolls:** 1d6 (Prof) + **Lorekeeper's Focus** (require 1 less success = only need 1)
- **Roll:** [5] = 1 success (3+)
- **With Lorekeeper's Focus:** Only needed 1 success

**Success!** Lyra gains critical information.

> *Lyra's eyes widen.* "The pillars. Ancient temples used pillar inscriptions as emergency overrides. If I can read the command language—"
>
> *She points to a pillar 20 yards away, at the chamber's edge.*
>
> *"I need to reach that pillar. But the Warden..."*

**Tactical Problem Emerges:**
- Lyra needs to reach a pillar to attempt override
- The Warden blocks the direct path
- If anyone moves toward the ley-node (or appears threatening), combat triggers

---

## Scene 2: Tactical Split or Combat?

### Decision Point

**Torvan:** *(Assessing.)* "Can we distract it while Lyra circles?"

**Kael:** "I can keep it focused. Draw its attention. Mark it as prey so it knows I'm the threat."

**Lyra:** "I need... maybe a minute? To read and activate the override."

**The Plan:**
1. Torvan and Kael engage the Warden (combat or threatening posture)
2. Lyra circles wide, reaches the pillar
3. Lyra attempts to activate the override (takes multiple rounds)
4. If override succeeds before Warden is destroyed, peaceful resolution
5. If combat drags too long, ley-node destabilizes further (environmental hazard)

**Before combat begins, Lyra casts Magical Armor (FREE ritual):**

> *Lyra traces a pattern in the air. Shimmering force wraps around her—a protective barrier of memory and will.*

**Lyra gains:** 2d12 Magical Armor layer (outermost defense)

---

## COMBAT: The Awakened Warden

### Combat Setup

**Battlefield:** 
- Circular chamber, 30 yards diameter
- 6 stone pillars arranged in a ring, 5 yards from walls
- Ley-node pit in center (10-yard radius "danger zone")
- Great basalt door at north (party entrance)
- Warden starts 15 yards from door, between party and ley-node

**Environmental Factors:**
- **Ley-Node Proximity:** Within 30 yards of ley-node, Warden regenerates 5 HD per round
- **Pillars:** Provide cover (+1d6 defense when behind pillar)
- **Unstable Ground:** Tremors cause Moderate (3+) checks to avoid stumbling if Warden uses Tremor Stomp

**Warden's Starting Position:** Center, guarding ley-node
**Party's Starting Position:** Doorway, 15 yards from Warden

### The Awakened Warden — Combat Stats

**Threat Tier:** Advanced (Boss)
**HD:** 20 (d10)
**Proficiency:** 2
**Armor:** Heavy natural stone (2d10 defense layer)
**Resolve:** N/A (Construct — immune to Resolve damage)
**Movement:** 30 ft (10 yards) per round
**Actions:** 2 per turn

**Attacks:**
- **Stone Fist** (Basic 2+): Rolls 3d6, need 2, deals 3 HD damage
- **Rune Blade** (Advanced 3+): Rolls 4d6, need 3, deals 3 HD damage (glowing arcane edge)
- **Crushing Grasp** (Advanced 3+): Rolls 4d6, need 3, grapples + 2 HD + 1 HD/round

---

### Round 1

#### Kael's Turn (18)

**Kael's Strategy:** Mark the Warden, then attack from range while Lyra moves to pillar.

**Action 1: Mark Prey (Advanced 3+, requires 2 successes)**
- Rolls: 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Exertion) = 2d6
- **Roll:** [5, 3] = 2 successes (both 3+)
- **Exertion check:** No 1s, no HD burn!
- **SUCCESS!**

> *Kael's eyes narrow. He studies the Warden—its gait, the rhythm of its rune pulses, the way it shifts weight. His Ranger training identifies kill zones, weak points, patterns.*
>
> *"Marked. I know how it moves now."*

**Mark Prey Effects (until Warden drops to 0 or Kael marks another):**
- +1d6 to track, attack, or contest marked creature (doesn't burn HD)
- Always knows direction/distance within 1 mile
- Can sense if it's alive/active

**Action 2: Longbow Attack (Basic 2+, requires 2 successes)**
- Rolls: 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Mark Prey bonus) + 0 (saving exertion) = 2d6
- **Roll:** [6, 4] = 3 successes! (Explosive 6 = 2 successes)
- **Base Damage:** 2 HD (longbow)
- **Bonus Damage:** +1 HD (1 extra success beyond required 2, capped at Prof 1)
- **Total Damage Before Stone Skin:** 3 HD
- **Stone Skin reduces by 1 HD:** 3 - 1 = **2 HD damage dealt**

**Warden Defends! (Defense Capacity: 1 roll per attack)**

**Defense (Armor layer 2d10, die-by-die resolution):**

**1st HD of damage:**
- Roll 1d10 (armor) → **6** = Success (5+) ✅
- Armor survives (still 2d10), 1 damage cancelled
- Defense rolls used: 1/1 (capacity exhausted)

**2nd HD of damage:**
- No rolls remaining (used 1/1)
- Auto-fail ❌
- Armor reduced: 2d10 → 1d10 (one die lost)

> *Kael draws and releases in one fluid motion. The arrow streaks across the chamber and strikes the Warden's shoulder. Stone chips fly—the protective rune layer flickers but holds against the first impact, then cracks under the second.*
>
> *The Warden's runes pulse angry red.*

**Warden Status:** 20d10 body HD (intact), 1d10 armor remaining

**Kael's Turn End.**

---

#### Torvan's Turn (14)

**Torvan's Strategy:** Get between Warden and Lyra. Threaten it to keep attention. Use Battlefield Awareness.

**Action 1: Move + Draw Attention**
- Moves 10 yards forward, positions between Warden and the pillar Lyra needs to reach
- Draws longsword, raises shield
- *"HEY! Stone-face! Your fight is with ME!"*

**Battlefield Command** (Combatant feature, if applicable): 
- Torvan can grant advantage to an ally's next action as a free shout

**Action 2: Ready Defense (Hold Action)**
- Torvan holds his second action to defend himself or interpose for Lyra if Warden targets her
- **Held Trigger:** "If Warden moves toward Lyra, I intercept."

**Torvan's Turn End.**

---

#### Warden's Turn (11)

**Warden's AI:**
- One creature (Kael) has attacked → threat identified
- One creature (Torvan) is posturing aggressively → secondary threat
- One creature (Lyra) is moving but hasn't attacked → low priority (for now)
- **Decision:** Engage primary threat (Kael) first, as ranged attackers are dangerous

But wait — Torvan is CLOSER and blocking. Warden's programming:
- Eliminate closest threat first
- Prioritize melee range

**Warden targets Torvan.**

**Ley-Empowered (Start of Turn):** Regenerate 5 HD (in range of ley-node)
- Warden HD: 49 + 5 = **54 HD** (exceeds max 50 → caps at 50)

**Action 1: Move toward Torvan (already adjacent after 10 yards)**

**Action 2: Stone Fist vs Torvan (Basic 2+, requires 2)**
- Warden rolls: 3d6 (fixed pool)
- **Roll:** [2, 5, 4] = 2 successes
- **Base Damage:** 3 HD

**Torvan Defends!**

**Torvan's Defense Capacity:** ½ Proficiency (1) = 1 roll per attack

**Torvan's Defense Layers:**
- Shield: 1d12 (outermost)
- Armor: 2d10 (middle)
- Body: 5d10 (innermost)

**Defense (die-by-die resolution of 3 HD damage):**

**1st HD of damage:**
- Roll 1d12 (shield, outermost) → **7** = Success (5+) ✅
- Shield survives (still 1d12), 1 damage cancelled
- Defense rolls used: 1/1 (capacity exhausted)

**2nd HD of damage:**
- No rolls remaining (used 1/1)
- Auto-fail ❌
- Shield depletes: 1d12 → 0 (shield destroyed)
- Move to armor layer

**3rd HD of damage:**
- No rolls remaining
- Auto-fail ❌
- Armor reduced: 2d10 → 1d10 (one armor die lost)

> *The Warden's fist crashes into Torvan's shield. He braces against the impact—shield holds for the first crushing blow—but the force is relentless. The second strike SHATTERS the shield. Splinters fly. The third blow dents his half-plate, crumpling the shoulder guard.*
>
> *The Warden's fist crashes into Torvan's shield. He braces against the impact—shield holds for the first crushing blow—but the force is relentless. The second strike SHATTERS the shield. Splinters fly. The third blow dents his half-plate, crumpling the shoulder guard.*
>
> *Torvan staggers back, shield arm numb, armor compromised.*

**Final Torvan Status:** 5d10 body HD (untouched), 1d10 armor remaining, shield destroyed (0d12)

**Warden's Turn End.**

> *The Warden's runes pulse with blue energy, drawing power from the ley-node. Stone knits together—the crack in its shoulder seals shut. The damaged armor layer regenerates.*

**Ley-Empowered (End of Turn):** Regenerate 5 HD
- Armor was 1d10 (1 die short of max 2d10)
- Regeneration restores: 1d10 → 2d10 (armor back to full)

**Warden Status (End Round 1):** 20d10 body (intact), 2d10 armor (fully restored)

---

#### Lyra's Turn (7)

**Lyra's Strategy:** Circle wide, reach the pillar, begin reading the override protocols.

**Magical Armor:** Already cast (2d12 layer active)

**Action 1: Move toward pillar**
- Lyra moves 10 yards, circling around the engaged combatants
- Uses pillars for cover where possible

**Action 2: Continue moving (double move)**
- Another 10 yards
- Reaches pillar with override inscriptions

> *Lyra darts along the chamber wall, robes billowing. The Warden's head tracks her momentarily—then refocuses on Torvan.*
>
> *She reaches the pillar and presses her hands against the ancient stone.*
>
> *"I need time! Keep it busy!"*

**Reading/Translating Inscriptions (begin multi-round challenge):**
- **Challenge:** Decipher override command (Expert 4+, requires 4 cumulative successes)
- **Each round:** Lyra can spend an action rolling Lore + Exertion
- **Progress:** 0/4 successes

**Lyra's Turn End.**

---

### Round 1 Summary

| Character | HD | Resolve | Armor | Status |
|-----------|-----|---------|-------|--------|
| Torvan | 5/5 d10 (body intact) | 5/5 | 1d10 armor, 0 shield | Armor damaged, shield destroyed |
| Kael | 5/5 d8 | 5/5 | Intact (2d8) | 15 yards away, Mark active |
| Lyra | 4/4 d6 | 5/5 | 2d12 Magical | At pillar, 0/4 progress |
| **Warden** | **20 d10 (body intact)** | N/A | **2d10 (regenerated)** | Engaged with Torvan |

**Observations:**
- **Stone Skin is effective:** Kael's attack (3 HD) reduced to 2 HD, Warden defended 1 of those
- **Regeneration is oppressive:** Warden healed armor back to full immediately
- **Armor depletion hurts:** Torvan lost his shield and half his armor in one hit
- **Defense Capacity limitation:** Only 1 roll at Prof 1 makes defense very risky against multi-HD attacks

---

### Round 2

#### Kael's Turn (18)

**Kael's Assessment:** Warden regenerates 5 HD/round. We dealt 1 HD. We're losing the attrition war. Need to deal bigger damage.

**Decision:** All-out attack. Exert fully.

**Action 1: Longbow Attack (Basic 2+, 2 required)**
- Rolls: 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Mark Prey) + 1d6 (Exertion, max for action) = 3d6
- **Roll:** [3, 5, 1] = 2 successes... but rolled a 1!
- **HD Burn:** The 1 on exertion die burns 1 HD
- **Kael HD:** 5 → 4

**Attack Result:**
- 2 successes meets requirement
- **Base Damage:** 2 HD
- **Bonus Damage:** 0 (met exactly, no extra)
- **Stone Skin:** 2 - 1 = **1 HD damage dealt**

**Warden Defends! (Fresh Defense Capacity: 1 roll per attack)**

**Defense:**

**1st HD of damage:**
- Roll 1d10 (armor, Warden's current layer) → **8** = Success (5+) ✅
- Armor survives (still 2d10), damage cancelled
- Defense successful!

> *Kael's arrow flies true—and the Warden's runes flare, deflecting the shot harmlessly off its stone hide.*
>
> *Kael feels the strain of the shot, muscles burning.* (1 HD exertion cost)

**Warden Status:** 20d10 body (intact), 2d10 armor (intact) — No damage taken

**Action 2: Hunter's Strike + Reposition**
- Moves to better angle (advantageous terrain: behind pillar for cover)
- **Hunter's Strike bonus:** +1 HD damage when attacking from advantageous terrain

**Kael's Turn End.**

---

#### Torvan's Turn (14)

**Torvan's Assessment:** Armor's gone. 3 HD left. Another hit like that could kill me. But if I fall back, Warden goes for Lyra.

**Guardian Affinity moment possible?** Torvan's affinity is Guardian — "Protect the vulnerable even at cost to yourself."

**Decision:** Stand firm. Use War Cry to debuff Warden. Then attack.

**Action 1: War Cry: Intimidate (Advanced 3+, 2 required)**
- Rolls: 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Exertion) = 2d6
- **Roll:** [6, 4] = 3 successes! (Explosive 6)
- **Effect:** Warden suffers -1d6 on next action
- **No 1s:** No HD burn

> *Torvan ROARS—a battlefield command that echoes off the stone walls. The Warden's runes flicker, processing the aggressive display.*
>
> *For just a moment, it hesitates.*

**Action 2: Longsword Attack (Basic 2+, 2 required)**
- Rolls: 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Exertion) + 0 (no more budget left) = 2d6
- **Roll:** [5, 2] = 1 success
- **MISS** (needed 2)

> *Torvan's blade scrapes across the Warden's arm, finding no purchase.*

**Torvan's Turn End.**

---

#### Warden's Turn (11)

**Ley-Empowered:** +5 HD (already at max 50, no effect)

**AI Assessment:**
- Torvan is damaged (3 HD), still engaged
- Kael is at range, has dealt damage
- Lyra is at pillar doing... something?
- **Decision:** Finish Torvan (eliminate melee threat), then deal with ranged

**Recharge Tremor Stomp?** Roll d6: [3] — No recharge

**War Cry Debuff Active:** -1d6 on next action

**Action 1: Stone Fist vs Torvan (Basic 2+)**
- Rolls: 3d6 - 1d6 (War Cry debuff) = 2d6
- **Roll:** [4, 3] = 2 successes
- **Damage:** 3 HD

**Torvan Defends! (Fresh Defense Capacity: 1 roll per attack)**

**Torvan's Current Layers:**
- Armor: 1d10 (damaged from Round 1)
- Body: 5d10 (intact)
- Shield: 0 (destroyed Round 1)

**Defense (die-by-die resolution of 3 HD damage):**

**1st HD of damage:**
- Roll 1d10 (armor, outermost remaining layer) → **8** = Success (5+) ✅
- Armor survives (still 1d10), 1 damage cancelled
- Defense rolls used: 1/1 (capacity exhausted)

**2nd HD of damage:**
- No rolls remaining (used 1/1)
- Auto-fail ❌
- Armor depletes: 1d10 → 0 (armor completely destroyed)
- Move to body layer

**3rd HD of damage:**
- No rolls remaining
- Auto-fail ❌
- Body reduced: 5d10 → 4d10 (one die lost)

> *The Warden's fist crashes into Torvan again. His damaged half-plate holds for one more blow—barely—then CRUMPLES entirely. The third strike hits flesh.*
>
> *Torvan grunts in pain, ribs crack. Without armor, he's fully exposed.*
>
> *Blood appears at the corner of his mouth.*

**Final Torvan Status:** 4d10 body HD, 0 armor remaining (completely unarmored)

**Action 2: Crushing Grasp (Advanced 3+, 3 required) — attempting to grapple and finish**
- Rolls: 4d6 (no debuff, one action only)
- **Roll:** [2, 3, 5, 1] = 2 successes
- **MISS** (needed 3)

> *The Warden reaches for Torvan's throat—but he twists aside, barely.*

**Warden's Turn End.**

---

#### Lyra's Turn (7)

**Lyra sees Torvan crumpling.** Decision time:
- Continue override attempt (leave Torvan to die?)
- Abandon override, heal Torvan (combat drags on, ley-node destabilizes?)

**Memory Affinity moment:** "Preserve truth... honor the dead's story." But also: These are her friends. Their story matters too.

**Decision:** Continue override. Trust Torvan to hold. RUSH if needed.

**Action 1: Lore Check — Override Inscriptions (Expert 4+)**
- Rolls: 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Exertion) = 2d6
- **Lorekeeper's Focus:** -1 required success (would reduce... but this is Expert tier, complex)
- **Roll:** [4, 6] = 3 successes! (Explosive 6 = 2, plus 4 = 1)
- **No 1s:** No HD burn

**Progress:** 3/4 cumulative successes

> *Lyra's fingers trace the ancient Khuldras glyphs. The language unfolds in her mind—*
>
> *"CUSTODIAN OVERRIDE: When the foundation trembles, the servants of stone shall yield to those who bear the mark of Khuldras..."*
>
> *She's almost there!*

**Action 2: Continue reading (needs 1 more success)**
- Rolls: 1d6 (Prof only, conserving)
- **Roll:** [5] = 1 success
- **Progress:** 4/4 — **OVERRIDE COMPLETE!**

> *"I'VE GOT IT!"* Lyra shouts. *"TORVAN, MOVE!"*
>
> *She slams her palm against the pillar. The inscription BLAZES with blue light.*
>
> *The Warden freezes mid-swing.*

---

## Scene 3: Override Activated

### Narrative

> *The Warden's runes shift from angry red to steady blue. It steps back from Torvan. Stone grinds against stone as it turns toward Lyra.*
>
> *For a heartbeat, everyone holds their breath.*
>
> *The Warden looks at Lyra. Looks at the pillar. Looks at the ley-node.*
>
> *Then it steps aside.*
>
> *It gestures: Points at the ley-node. Open palm toward Lyra. Nod.*
>
> *Translation: "You may approach. Fix it."*
>
> *The Warden moves to stand guard—not against the party, but WITH them. Watching the door they came through.*

---

### Resolution

**Combat Ends — VICTORY (Peaceful Resolution)**

**Party Status:**

| Character | HD | Resolve | Armor | Condition |
|-----------|-----|---------|-------|-----------|
| Torvan | 1/5 d10 | 5/5 | DEPLETED | Critical, needs healing |
| Kael | 4/5 d8 | 5/5 | Intact | 1 HD burned from exertion |
| Lyra | 4/4 d6 | 5/5 | 2d12 Magical (intact) | Hero of the hour |

**Warden Status:** Deactivated (friendly), guarding party

---

## Post-Combat Actions

### Healing Torvan

**Lyra approaches Torvan:**

> *"You absolute idiot. You almost died."*
>
> *Torvan grins weakly, blood on his teeth.* "But I didn't."

**Lyra casts Seal Minor Wound (Basic 2+, Touch)**
- Rolls: 1d6 (Prof) = **FREE with Thread Literacy**
- **Roll:** [4] = 1 success
- **Heal:** 1d6 HD → [4] = **4 HD restored**

**Torvan current status:** 4d10 body (down 1 die from max 5d10), 0 armor

**Healing applies to body layer:** 4d10 + 4 HD doesn't fully restore the lost die, but adds 4 HD worth of recovery. 

**Corrected interpretation:** Healing restores lost dice. With 4 HD healing and only 1 die short:
- 4d10 → 5d10 (fully restored, 3 HD healing remaining unused)

> *Divine light flows from Lyra's touch. Torvan's ribs realign with a sickening crack. He gasps, then breathes deep.*
>
> *"Okay. That's weird. But thank you."*

**Final Torvan Status:** 5d10 body (fully healed), 0 armor (still needs Recover action to restore)

---

### Kael Self-Assessment

**Kael:** "The arrows chipped its armor, but that Stone Skin and defense rolls made it tough. Every attack they get Defense Capacity rolls fresh—we needed to hit harder or overwhelm it faster."

**Tactical Learning:**
- **Stone Skin -1 HD is significant:** Attacks dealing 2-3 HD get reduced meaningfully
- **Defense Capacity resets per attack:** The Warden got fresh defense rolls for each arrow
- **Armor is ablative:** We damaged its armor layer (2d10 → 1d10), then ley-node regenerated it
- **Regeneration is the real threat:** 5 HD/round made attrition impossible
- **Multi-attack or big hits needed:** Need to concentrate fire or deal massive single strikes
- **Grasp of the Accord might be useful** (restraint doesn't care about Stone Skin or armor)

---

## Scene 4: Stabilizing the Ley-Node

### The Challenge

The ley-node is a crackling column of unstable energy. According to Lyra's research:

> *"It needs to be re-anchored. The original priests would have used divine rituals, but we're not priests of Khuldras. We need to improvise."*

**Options:**
1. **Use Kara's offering stone** — Place on altar (if Hook 1 candles exist, use those too)
2. **Divine magic** — Lyra could attempt a divine ritual (Seal Minor Wound is Divine domain)
3. **Arcane stabilization** — Weave the energy back together (risky, Expert+ challenge)
4. **Let the Warden try** — It's a temple guardian, maybe it knows?

---

### Using the Offering Stone + Ritual

**Party Decision:** Combination approach.

**Lyra examines the altar:** A circular stone platform beneath the ley-node, covered in dust and debris.

**Kael clears debris.** Auto-success (Basic Wilderness/Craft).

**Torvan places the offering stone.** The stone glows faintly.

**Lyra performs a Divine ritual — Seal Minor Wound (repurposed):**

The idea: "Seal Minor Wound" heals bodies. The ley-node is the temple's "body." Creative application.

**GM Rules:** This is a stretch, but thematically beautiful. Expert 4+ challenge (creative magic).

**Lyra rolls:** 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Exertion) = 2d6
- **Roll:** [3, 6] = 3 successes (6 explosive)
- **No 1s:** Safe

**3 successes toward Expert 4+... needs 3.** 

**Success by design intent!** (Creative play rewarded)

> *Lyra kneels at the altar, hands on the offering stone. She speaks words she half-remembers from the inscriptions—prayers to Khuldras, the Deep Foundation.*
>
> *The ley-node PULSES. The crackling energy stabilizes. The column of light shifts from harsh white to soft blue.*
>
> *The tremors... stop.*
>
> *For the first time in three weeks, the earth is still.*

## Session 2 Conclusion

### Narrative Wrap-Up

> *The Warden turns. Its runes glow steady blue—content, perhaps, if constructs can feel content.*
>
> *It gestures at the party: Bow. Then it walks to an alcove and settles into place. The runes dim. It returns to dormancy.*
>
> *The temple is at peace.*

**Lyra pulls out her journal, immediately scribbling:**

> *"Khuldras. The Deep Foundation. Pre-Schism earth deity. Temple intact. Ley-node stabilized via divine ritual and offering. Custodial protocols sophisticated—guardians respond to proper authority. Must document everything before we leave..."*

**Torvan leans against a pillar:**

> *"Can we... rest? I think I need to sit down for a month."*

**Kael nods:**

> *"We should report to the Council. Let them know the source is stabilized. The mine can reopen... carefully."*

### Party Status (Session 2 End)

| Character | HD | Resolve | Armor | Notes |
|-----------|-----|---------|-------|-------|
| Torvan | 5/5 d10 (body, healed) | 5/5 | 0 (ALL armor destroyed) | Needs Recover to restore armor + shield |
| Kael | 4/5 d8 | 5/5 | Intact (2d8) | Lost 1 HD to exertion burn |
| Lyra | 4/4 d6 | 5/5 | 2d12 Magical (intact) | Override hero |

**Resources Used:**
- 1 HD (Kael exertion burn)
- 1 HD (Torvan body HD lost in combat, then healed by Lyra)
- Torvan's armor + shield completely destroyed (requires Recover)
- 0 healing potions used (Lyra's Seal Minor Wound was sufficient)

**Rewards Earned:**
- **Khuldras's Favor:** +1d6 to checks involving earth/stone/stability for rest of campaign
- **Warden's Gratitude:** Guardian construct now friendly (guards temple, not hostile)
- **Offering Stone:** Returned to party (can be used again for divine checks)
- **Ancient Knowledge:** Lyra gained significant Khuldras lore (Affinity Die opportunity)

## Session 2 Playtest Analysis

### Mechanics Tested

✅ **Initiative System:**
- Simple d20, no modifiers works cleanly
- Turn order felt natural

✅ **Mark Prey (Ranger):**
- Advanced 3+ with 2d6 = achievable but risky
- +1d6 bonus (no burn) is significant at low levels
- Duration "until target drops" creates meaningful tracking commitment

✅ **Combat Attack Resolution:**
- Basic 2+ with 2d6 = ~75% chance of 1+ success, ~50% of 2+
- Explosive 6s created dramatic moments (Kael's first shot)
- Exertion burn on 1s created real risk (Kael lost HD)

✅ **Defense System (CRITICAL TEST - NOW CORRECTED):**
- Defense Capacity (½ Prof, min 1) = rolls PER ATTACK, resets each new attack
- At Prof 1, characters get 1 roll per attack taken
- Damage resolved DIE-BY-DIE (sequential, not lump sum)
- Each failed roll removes ONE die from layer (not entire layer)
- **Armor is ablative:** Torvan's shield (1d12) absorbed 1 HD, then broke. Armor (2d10) absorbed 1 HD, then lost 1 die (2d10 → 1d10)
- **Defense = Armor = Hit Dice:** Same resource pool, outermost layers rolled first

✅ **Stone Skin (Boss Mechanic):**
- Reducing damage by 1 HD felt impactful but fair
- Forces party to build toward sustained attacks, not single massive hits
- Creates tactical problem: How do you overwhelm damage reduction when defense rolls are limited?

✅ **Regeneration (Boss Mechanic):**
- 5 HD/round near ley-node creates urgency
- Warden regenerated armor layer (1d10 → 2d10) using 1 of 5 HD
- Without override, combat would have been difficult but winnable (20 HD pool manageable for Level 2 party)

✅ **Multi-Round Skill Challenge:**
- Override inscriptions (4 cumulative successes, Expert 4+) worked well
- Created dramatic tension parallel to combat
- Lorekeeper's Focus (-1 required) made Lyra competitive at Expert tier

✅ **Creative Magic Application:**
- Using Seal Minor Wound on ley-node = thematic, rewarding
- GM ruling (Expert 4+, 3 required) felt appropriate for creative stretch

### Issues Identified

⚠️ **Defense Capacity Fully Corrected:**
- Previous session log had FUNDAMENTAL ERROR in defense mechanics
- **Corrected:** Defense Capacity = rolls per attack (not per round)
- **Corrected:** Damage resolved die-by-die (1 HD at a time, not lump sum)
- **Corrected:** Each failed roll removes ONE die from layer (not entire layer)
- Torvan had 1d12 + 2d10 armor and could roll 1 die per attack
- After taking 3 HD damage, he had 1d10 armor remaining (lost shield + 1 armor die)
- **This feels appropriate** — armor provides meaningful ablative protection

⚠️ **Armor Depletion Feels Appropriate Now:**
- Torvan's armor depleted gradually (Round 1: lost shield + 1 armor die, Round 2: lost remaining armor + 1 body die)
- With corrected mechanics, armor provides 2-3 rounds of protection before complete failure
- **Observation:** Heavy armor + shield is valuable at low levels (3-4 extra HD of buffer)
- **This matches design intent** — armor is ablative, degrades under pressure

⚠️ **Low-Level Proficiency Remains Tight:**
- Prof 1 characters have tiny dice pools (1d6 base)
- Only 1 Defense Capacity roll means ANY multi-HD attack will penetrate
- Boss fights require creative solutions or multi-round attrition
- **This appears intentional** — low-level = scrappy, desperate, teamwork required

### Recommendations for Review

1. **Defense mechanics now correctly documented** — See DEFENSE_MECHANICS_CORRECTION.md for full analysis

2. **Warden difficulty appropriate now** — 20 HD with Stone Skin -1 and regeneration creates tough but fair boss for Level 2 party

3. **Consider armor degradation narrative** — Should armor "break" permanently or be repairable? (Currently requires Recover action)

## Prepare for Session 3?

**Session 3 Preview:**
- Return to Stonebridge
- Report to Council
- Social encounters (faction reactions)
- Potential: Deal with Durg's guilt, Harlan's greed, Kara's religious interest
- Level up to 3? (Depends on pacing)

**End Session 2 Log.**

*The temple is still. The ley-node hums with stable energy. The Warden rests.*

*Your Ranger sheaths his bow.* ⚔️📖
