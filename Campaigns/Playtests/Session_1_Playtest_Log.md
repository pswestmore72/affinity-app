## Hook: Standard Arrival (Option 2)

The three characters arrive in Stonebridge independently via the trade road, each drawn by news of the crisis:
- **Kael:** Hired as wilderness guide by traveling merchants, heard about the tremors
- **Torvan:** Traveling bodyguard, diverted to help when he learned of trapped miners
- **Lyra:** Scholar documenting ancient sites, couldn't resist an 800-year-old unsealed temple

---

## Scene 1: The Tremor (Opening)

### Narrative

> **The stone bridge spans the Cragrun River, connecting the two halves of Stonebridge. You cross it mid-afternoon—three strangers bound for the same troubled town.**
>
> **The ground shudders.**
>
> **Not a violent quake—a deep, rolling tremor like the earth shifting in its sleep. Pebbles dance on the bridge stones. A child on the south bank cries out. Merchants on the north side grab at wobbling crates to prevent them toppling into the river.**
>
> **From a balcony above the market square, a woman shouts: "That's the third one this morning!"**
>
> **As the tremor subsides, you notice: Everyone looks exhausted. Worried. On edge. The town square ahead is packed—not with shoppers, but with anxious residents gathered before the Town Hall steps where five figures stand arguing loudly.**

### Mechanical Observations

**No checks required for tremor** - environmental storytelling, sets tone.

**Party First Impressions** (instinctive character reactions):

**Kael (Ranger):** 
- Feels tremor through boots, reads it like a ranger reads weather
- *"These aren't natural quakes. Too regular. Something's actively disturbing the earth."*
- **Nature's Treaty (Passive):** Automatically recognizes this is NOT geological—magical or structural disturbance

**Torvan (Combatant):**
- Battlefield Awareness kicks in - scans for immediate danger
- Notices the civilians' body language: Exhausted. Terrified. Some families have packed wagons (fleeing)
- *"These people need stability. Someone has to act before panic becomes exodus."*
- Protective instincts already engaged

**Lyra (Weaver):**
- Immediately curious - pulls out journal to document the tremor pattern
- **Weave Sight (if active):** Would reveal subtle Weave distortions radiating from the west (direction of The Delve)
- *"If this is magical resonance, there's a pattern. I need to see the source."*
- Already thinking about what ancient structure could cause this

---

## Scene 2: The Divided Council (Public Argument)

### Narrative

> **The Town Hall steps are a stage for barely-contained chaos. Five Council members stand before ~100 townsfolk, shouting over each other:**
>
> **A dwarf priestess in bronze-trimmed robes (Kara Ironshod) gestures angrily:** **"We disturbed something sacred! You don't break ancient seals and expect no consequences! We should collapse Shaft #7, seal the breach, and apologize to whatever gods we've offended!"**
>
> **A human in guard captain's armor (Torvald Greystone) crosses his arms:** **"I've got four dead miners and eight traumatized. We're NOT going back down there. Seal it, post guards, move on."**
>
> **A young woman in practical clothes (Mira Ashford) raises her voice:** **"My people are terrified! Children aren't sleeping! We need to FIX this—seal it OR clear it, whichever is SAFER!"**
>
> **A dwarf in mining gear (Durg Blackiron) pounds his fist:** **"That chamber is enormous! We've barely scratched the surface! There could be treasure, lost knowledge, rare ores! We can't just walk away after everything we've—"** *(He catches himself, guilt flickering across his face)*
>
> **A well-dressed human merchant (Harlan Vex) spreads his hands placatingly:** **"If we seal the mine permanently, Stonebridge's economy collapses. We'll be a ghost town in two years. We NEED to go back—CAREFULLY—and secure whatever's down there."**
>
> **The argument escalates. Kara shouts about divine punishment. Torvald talks over her about safety. Mira tries to mediate. Durg looks defensive. Harlan calculates costs.**
>
> **The crowd mutters. Arguments spread through the gathered townsfolk like wildfire.**

### Character Reactions & Potential Actions

**At this point, the party can:**
- Listen and gather information (Investigation/Awareness checks to read the situation)
- Approach Council members privately
- Speak up publicly (Influence checks, social spotlight)
- Investigate the town while Council argues

**Option A: Listen & Observe (What Most Groups Do)**

If the party hangs back and observes:

**Awareness Check (Basic 2+)** to notice key details:

**Kael rolls:** 1d6 (Prof 1) = let's simulate: **[ROLL]** → **4** (1 success)
- **Success:** Notices Durg's body language - the dwarf foreman is GUILTY. He keeps glancing at the families, flinching when mothers mention their dead sons. This wasn't malicious greed—it was ambition + a catastrophic mistake.
- **Also notices:** Militia Captain Torvald has positioned guards at the mine road entrance (west edge of town). They're preventing anyone from approaching The Delve.

**Torvan rolls:** 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[ROLL]** → **5** (1 success)
- **Success (Battlefield Awareness applies):** Reads the tactical situation. The town is fracturing along economic lines:
  - **Poor families** (miners' relatives) side with Kara and Torvald (seal it, safety first)
  - **Merchants and landowners** side with Harlan and Durg (economic survival)
  - **Mira (swing vote)** is genuinely torn, trying to represent both groups
- **Critical observation:** If this argument continues, the town will split. Someone needs to break the deadlock with ACTION.

**Lyra rolls:** 1d6 (Prof 1) + **Lorekeeper's Focus** applies if using Lore to recall information
- Let's say she's trying to recall if she's read about anything like this: **Lore check (Moderate 3+)** to recall information about sealed temples/quakes
- Rolls: 1d6 (Prof 1) = **[ROLL]** → **3** (1 success, but needs 2 for Moderate)
- **Failure initially**, but then she activates **Comprehend Languages** as a ritual (takes 10 minutes of chanting while studying old maps from her satchel)
- After ritual: Recalls reading about **Khuldras, the Deep Foundation** - a pre-Schism deity of earth/stability/buried secrets
- **Key insight:** Temples to earth deities use ley-node architecture. Breaking seals would destabilize the ley-node. If left unchecked → catastrophic collapse.
- Lyra's eyes widen. She scribbles notes frantically.

**Information Gathered:**
- The Council is deadlocked 2-2 with 1 swing vote (Mira)
- Durg feels guilty but is defensive
- Economic pressure is real (closing mine = town dies slowly)
- Magical/divine cause suspected
- Lyra has critical lore: This will get WORSE, not better

---

### Option B: Approach the Council (Social Engagement)

If the party approaches the Council directly:

**Torvan's Approach (Most Likely):**
Torvan is a veteran guard captain - he recognizes this deadlock. He steps forward, calm and authoritative:

> **"Council members. Citizens."** *(His voice cuts through the argument - not loud, but COMMANDING)*
> 
> **"I'm Torvan Steelhand, formerly Captain of the Moonvault Guard. I've seen situations like this before. While you argue, the problem worsens. Tremors are increasing. That means whatever was disturbed is ACTIVE."**
> 
> **"You need someone to go down there. Assess the situation. Determine if it can be sealed safely or must be cleared. You need professionals who aren't emotionally invested."**
> 
> **He gestures to Kael and Lyra.** **"We're not from here. We have no stake in your politics. We can give you an unbiased report—and if action is needed, we can take it."**

**Influence Check (Advanced 3+)** - Torvan's trying to convince the Council AND the crowd:

**Torvan rolls:** 1d6 (Prof 1) + 0-1d6 (Exertion if he pushes)
- Let's say he uses **1 Exertion die** (this is important, wants solid success)
- Rolls: **1d6 (Prof) = 5**, **1d6 (Exertion) = 3**
- **Total: 2 successes (both 3+), needs 2 for Advanced**
- **SUCCESS!**
- No 1s rolled - no HD burn

**Result:**

The Council members pause. The crowd quiets.

**Priestess Kara:** *(Narrows eyes)* "You're not just passing through. Why would you help?"

**Torvan:** *"Because twelve people are dead and more will die if nothing changes. That's reason enough."*

**Captain Torvald:** *(Studies Torvan)* "You said you were a guard captain. I recognize command presence when I see it." *(Nods slowly)* "If you're volunteering... I'll support it. Better you than sending more of my miners into that deathtrap."

**Harlan Vex (merchant):** *(Smoothly)* "And if these professionals happen to map the chamber's contents while they're ensuring safety... that serves everyone's interests, yes?"

**Kara:** *(Suspicious, but relenting)* "If you go down there, you approach with RESPECT. That's a temple—not a treasure vault. The divine doesn't forgive desecration."

**Durg:** *(Quietly, relieved)* "I can give you a map of what we found. And... I can tell you what we did wrong."

**Mira:** *(To the crowd)* "These strangers are offering to risk their lives for us. I say we let them try." *(Looks at the party)* "What do you need to prepare?"

---

### Mechanical Decision Point: Contract Terms

The Council offers:

**Payment:**
- **200 gold upfront** (split between party: ~67g each)
- **500 gold upon resolution** (whether sealed or cleared, as long as tremors stop)
- **10% of any "recovered materials"** (Harlan's addition - if they find treasure, town takes 90%, party keeps 10%)

**Supplies Provided:**
- Healing potions (×3) - 1d6+1 HD each
- Rope, torches, rations
- Map of Shaft #7 + Chamber layout (incomplete)
- Torvald offers militia escort to mine entrance (party can decline if they want stealth)

**Party can negotiate** (Influence checks), but this is generous for a small town.

**Do the characters accept?**

**Kael's Response:** *(Pragmatic)* "The payment's fair. But I care more about stopping those tremors. Natural balance doesn't include ancient magic tearing apart a mountain."

**Lyra's Response:** *(Excited)* "You're giving us access to an 800-year-old temple? I'd do it for FREE if I could document the inscriptions!" *(Catches herself)* "But yes, payment is appreciated."

**Torvan's Response:** *(Looks at the crowd - exhausted mothers, frightened children)* "We'll do it. Keep your upfront payment—give it to the miners' families. We'll take the completion bounty."

**Mechanical Note:** Torvan just sacrificed 67g to show good faith. This is **Guardian affinity in action** - "protect the defenseless." 

**GM Decision:** Award Torvan **1 Affinity Die** (max 1 per day at Prof 1)
- Torvan gains: 1 Affinity Die stored (max 2 at Level 2)
- Can spend on any future roll as exertion die (burns HD on 1s)

---

### Scene 3: Preparation & NPC Interactions (Town Exploration)

The party has ~2 hours before the Council wants them to depart. They can:
- Talk to NPCs (gather information)
- Purchase supplies
- Rest/prepare spells
- Investigate the town

**Key NPCs Available:**

1. **Priestess Kara Ironshod** (Temple)
2. **Captain Torvald Greystone** (Militia Station)
3. **Foreman Durg Blackiron** (Miners' Rest tavern, drinking heavily)
4. **Harlan Vex** (Market square, "shopping")
5. **Jenna Coalhand** (Traumatized survivor, at the temple seeking comfort)

**Where does the party go? (GM chooses most narratively interesting 2-3)**

**Most Likely:**
- **Torvan** → Militia Station (talks tactics with Torvald)
- **Lyra** → Temple (researches Khuldras with Kara)
- **Kael** → Durg at tavern (gets firsthand account of what happened)

---

#### Interaction 1: Kael & Durg (Miners' Rest Tavern)

**Kael enters the tavern. Durg sits alone, bottle half-empty.**

**Kael:** *(Direct, no judgment)* "Durg Blackiron. I'm heading down to fix what you opened. Tell me exactly what happened."

**Durg:** *(Looks up, bloodshot eyes)* "You here to judge me like everyone else?"

**Kael:** "No. I'm here to make sure I don't repeat your mistakes."

**Durg:** *(Pauses, then nods)* "...Fair." *(Takes a drink)* "We hit a cavity. Huge. Walls too smooth—carved, not natural. I should've reported it. Should've waited for the Council. But I saw... opportunity. Thought maybe we'd found an old vault. Riches that could save the town."

**Kael:** "What did you do?"

**Durg:** "We found a door. Black basalt. Covered in circular locks—geometric patterns. Two statues flanking it. I thought they were decoration." *(Bitter laugh)* "I ordered my crew to break the seals. We smashed six locks carefully. The seventh... I got impatient. Hit it with a pickaxe."

**Kael:** "And the statues woke up."

**Durg:** "Turned their heads. Stepped forward. One of my boys panicked—ran at them with a hammer. The guardian grabbed him... crushed him like kindling." *(Looks away)* "We ran. Left him there. I'm a coward."

**Kael:** *(After a moment)* "You're not going back down?"

**Durg:** "They won't let me. Torvald said if I try, he'll arrest me for endangering lives." *(Looks at Kael)* "But you... you look like someone who understands wild things. Those guardians—they weren't evil. They were... defending. Like wolves protecting a den. If you approach them right..."

**Information Gained:**
- Six locks were carefully opened; seventh was smashed (damaged)
- Guardians are TERRITORIAL, not mindlessly aggressive
- Door likely leads deeper into temple
- Durg provides crude map showing chamber layout, pillar positions, door location

**Kael's Takeaway:** This is like approaching a bear's cave. Respect the space, show you're not a threat, or prepare for violence.

---

#### Interaction 2: Lyra & Priestess Kara (Ore & Iron Shrine)

**Lyra enters the temple - small, practical, dedicated to Murien (craft/story/artisanship).**

**Kara is praying before an altar covered in tools**: hammer, chisel, inkpot, scroll.

**Lyra:** *(Respectfully quiet until prayer finishes)* "Priestess Kara. I'm one of the... adventurers heading below. I study ancient religions. Can you tell me about Khuldras?"

**Kara:** *(Turns, surprised)* "You know the name? Even I had to dig through archives to find it."

**Lyra:** *(Excited)* "I've read fragments! Pre-Schism worship, yes? Khuldras the Deep Foundation—deity of earth, stability, buried secrets. Stone-circle builders, labyrinth temples, ley-node manipulation for—"

**Kara:** *(Holds up hand, smiling despite herself)* "Slow down, scholar. Yes. All true. Khuldras was revered by the mountain-folk 800 years ago. When they vanished—no one knows why—their temples were sealed. Deliberately. BY their own priests."

**Lyra:** "Why seal them?"

**Kara:** "Because Khuldras's temples aren't passive. They're anchored to ley-nodes—channels of raw magical energy beneath the earth. If the temple's guardians and wards aren't maintained... the ley-node destabilizes. That's what Durg triggered. The quakes will worsen until someone re-seals the temple OR stabilizes the ley-node directly."

**Lyra:** "How do we stabilize it?"

**Kara:** "I don't know the exact ritual. Khuldras isn't my god—Murien is. But I know this: The guardians will recognize divine authority. If someone approaches with proper respect—prayers, offerings, gestures of peace—they might allow passage instead of killing you."

**Lyra:** "What kind of offerings?"

**Kara:** *(Thinks)* "Earth deities value... foundation. Stability. Craft. Something built with care, or something that represents commitment to balance."

Kara gives Lyra **a small carved stone** - a perfectly balanced cube. "This was my journeyman work. Give it to the altar below. It might help."

**Information Gained:**
- Ley-node must be stabilized OR temple re-sealed
- Guardians respond to divine authority/respect
- Offering: Carved stone (may grant advantage on social check with guardians)
- Ritual details likely IN the temple (need to explore to find instructions)

---

#### Interaction 3: Torvan & Captain Torvald (Militia Station)

**Torvan finds Torvald organizing guard rotations. The Captain looks grateful to see him.**

**Torvald:** "Steelhand. The Council approved your plan—you're heading down. I want to give you what support I can."

**Torvan:** "What can you tell me about the chamber?"

**Torvald:** "Not much. Durg's crew only had ten minutes before the guardians activated. The chamber is massive—at least 100 yards across, pillared. The door at the far end is sealed. Two guardian-statues flank it. When they woke up, Durg's crew bolted."

**Torvan:** "Have you sent scouts since?"

**Torvald:** *(Grimly)* "Twice. First pair returned immediately—said the guardians were 'watching' but didn't attack as long as they stayed near the entrance. Second pair tried to approach the door. Guardians stepped forward, blocking them. When they persisted... one guardian grabbed a scout and threw him twenty feet into a pillar. Broke his ribs. We pulled him out."

**Torvan:** "So they're territorial, not automatically hostile."

**Torvald:** "Exactly. Like guard dogs. If you respect boundaries, they tolerate you. Cross the line..." *(Shrugs)* "I've got climbing gear, rope, medical supplies here. Take what you need. And..." *(Reaches into a chest, pulls out a steel shield with the town's crest)* "This was my spare. Heavy armor, shield and sword—you fight like I used to. Take it."

**Torvan receives: Steel Shield (1d12 temp HD), climbing kit, healer's kit (5 uses)**

**Torvan:** "I'll bring your people home safe, Captain."

**Torvald:** "I believe you. May Caerith watch over you."

---

### Scene 3B: Quick Shopping/Prep (If Needed)

**Stonehammer Inn** has limited supplies:
- Healing potions (1d6+1 HD) - 25g each
- Rope (50 ft) - 1g
- Torches (10) - 1sp
- Rations (7 days) - 3.5g

**Party already has most of this**. Likely purchases:
- **1-2 extra healing potions** (Lyra has 4 HD - she NEEDS backup healing)

**Purchased:** 2 healing potions (50g from party funds)

---

### Pre-Departure Status Check

**Party Resources:**

---

## Scene 4: Descent into The Delve (Journey to Chamber)

**Militia escorts the party to Mine Shaft #7 entrance. Torvald's guards stand watch outside.**

**The journey down Shaft #7 takes ~20 minutes of descending through worked tunnels:**

> **The air grows colder as you descend. Torchlight flickers across support beams and tool marks—decades of mining carved these passages. But as you go deeper, the walls change.**
>
> **The rough-hewn stone gives way to smooth, dressed blocks. Ancient. Pre-dating the mine by centuries. You've crossed from mortal excavation into something older.**
>
> **Kael's torch illuminates bloodstains on the floor—three weeks old, dried brown. Drag marks lead back toward the entrance. This is where Durg's crew fled.**
>
> **Ahead, the tunnel opens into vast darkness. Your torchlight barely reaches the ceiling.**

**No encounters during descent** - this is atmospheric buildup.

**Wilderness/Awareness checks (Basic 2+)** to notice details:

**Kael:** Auto-succeeds (Nature's Treaty passive - Basic tier automatic)
- Notices: Air temperature drop isn't from depth—it's from STAGNANT magic. The Weave is thick here, stale, disturbed.
- Blood patterns: Three miners fled, one was dragged (likely the casualty Durg mentioned)

**Torvan:** Rolls 1d6 (Prof) = **[4]** - Success
- Battlefield Awareness: This is a choke point. If guardians activate, the narrow tunnel is a kill zone. Need to enter the chamber, give yourself room to maneuver.

**Lyra:** Activates **Weave Sight** (Basic 2+, FREE cast thanks to Thread Literacy)
- Rolls 1d6 (Prof) = **[3]** - 1 success, range = 10 yards
- Sees: The chamber ahead BLAZES with Weave-light. Active magical constructs (guardians), ley-line distortions, ward-sigils on the pillars. This is a WORKING temple, not a ruin.

---

## Scene 5: The Guardian Chamber (First Contact)

> **You emerge into the chamber. Your torches are inadequate—this space is VAST. Vaulted ceiling 40 feet up, supported by twelve massive pillars carved with geometric patterns. The floor is polished stone, covered in three weeks of dust and the scuff marks of panicked flight.**
>
> **At the far end, 100 yards away, stands THE DOOR. Black basalt, 15 feet tall, covered in seven circular lock-mechanisms. Six are intact. The seventh is shattered—pickaxe damage, crude and violent.**
>
> **Flanking the door: TWO STATUES.**
>
> **No.** *(Lyra whispers)* **"Not statues. Constructs."**
>
> **They are humanoid—9 feet tall, carved from seamless granite. Blank faceplates. Runes etched across their bodies. They stand perfectly still, hands at their sides.**
>
> **As your torchlight touches them, THEIR HEADS TURN.**
>
> **Slow. Grinding. Stone-on-stone scraping fills the chamber.**
>
> **Blue runes flare to life across their bodies.**
>
> **They do not attack. They WATCH.**

---

### Decision Point: How Does the Party Approach?

**Options:**
1. **Diplomatic Approach** - Show respect, use Kara's offering, attempt communication
2. **Cautious Advance** - Move slowly, assess reactions, ready for combat
3. **Immediate Combat** - Assume hostility, strike first
4. **Investigation** - Examine the chamber/pillars before approaching guardians

**Most narratively appropriate: Option 1 (Diplomatic Approach)**

Torvan would advocate for Option 1 (protect party, avoid unnecessary combat)  
Lyra would STRONGLY advocate for Option 1 (this is sacred ground, respect it)  
Kael would suggest caution but defer to group

**Party Consensus: Attempt Diplomacy**

---

###Diplomatic Approach (Key Scene - Testing Social Mechanics & Guardian AI)

**Torvan steps forward first** - he's the tank, draws attention.

**Torvan:** *(Loudly, but respectfully)* "Guardians of Khuldras! We come NOT as thieves or desecrators. We seek to repair what was broken by mortal foolishness."

**The guardians do not move. They watch.**

**Lyra steps forward next**, clutching Kara's carved stone.

**Lyra:** *(Voice shaking slightly)* "I am Lyra Ashveil, seeker of knowledge. I honor the Deep Foundation and those who built this sacred place. Please... let us pass. We want to stabilize the Ley-Node, to repair the damage."

**Lyra places Kara's carved stone on the ground between her and the guardians.**

**GM Note:** This is **Influence check (Advanced 3+)** - attempting to convince constructs bound by ancient programming.

**Lyra rolls:** 1d6 (Prof 1) + any Exertion = let's say she uses **1 Exertion die** (this is critical, she NEEDS success)
- Rolls: **1d6 (Prof) = 2**, **1d6 (Exertion) = 6**
- **Total: 1 success (only the 6 counts as 3+ for Advanced tier)**
- **Failure** - needs 2 successes for Advanced
- **But**: Kara's offering stone is a **narrative advantage** - let's say it grants +1d6 reliable die (doesn't burn HD on 1s)
- Bonus die: **[3]** - Success!
- **FINAL RESULT: 2 successes (3 and 6) - SUCCESS at Advanced tier!**

---

**The guardians' heads tilt. Processing.**

**One guardian raises its hand—palm out. Universal symbol: STOP.**

**The other guardian... kneels.**

**It picks up the carved stone. Studies it. Then carefully places it at the base of the sealed door.**

**Both guardians step ASIDE.**

**The path to the door is clear.**

---

**Mechanical Observations - Playtest Notes:**

✅ **Social encounter worked!** Influence check + narrative advantage (offering stone) created non-combat resolution.  
✅ **Proficiency 1 + 1 Exertion = tight margins** - Level 2 characters struggling with Advanced checks is appropriate tension.  
✅ **Narrative advantage as +1d6** felt fair (offering stone earned through RP).  
⚠️ **Guardian behavior clarity:** Need rules for "construct intelligence" - how do they evaluate threats vs respect?  

**SUCCESS: Guardians allow passage without combat.**

---

## Scene 6: The Sealed Door (Puzzle Challenge)

> **You approach the door. Up close, the damage is obvious. Six circular lock-mechanisms are intact—geometric wheels nested within wheels, waiting to be aligned. The seventh is SMASHED. Pickaxe blows shattered the stone, leaving jagged fragments and exposed internal mechanisms.**
>
> **Lyra kneels, examining the locks closely.**

**Investigation Check (Moderate 3+)** to understand the mechanism:

**Lyra rolls:** 1d6 (Prof) + her **Lorekeeper's Focus feat** applies (recall ancient mechanisms)
- Rolls: **1d6 = 5** - Success!
- **Lorekeeper's Focus:** "Once per scene after successfully identifying [a thing] through Lore, gain +1d6 to next action related to that knowledge."
- She identifies this as a **harmonic lock system** - all seven must be aligned for the door to open
- **Gains +1d6 for next action related to repairing/opening the locks**

**Lyra:** "It's a harmonic system. All seven locks must align simultaneously. The pattern..." *(Studies the intact locks)* "...it's mathematical. Based on sacred geometry. Earth deities favor patterns of seven—seven elements, seven foundations, seven truths."

**Kael:** "Can we repair the broken lock?"

**Lyra:** "Maybe. If we understand the pattern and can improvise the mechanism..."

**Craft Check (Moderate 3+)** to repair the broken lock:

This is a **team effort**:
- **Lyra:** Understands the pattern (Lore)
- **Kael:** Has practical wilderness repair skills
- **Torvan:** Has steady hands from weapon maintenance

**Team Check:** GM ruling - let ONE character lead, others can Assist.

**Kael leads** (Ranger with practical skills), Lyra and Torvan assist (+1d6 each from Help action):

**Kael rolls:** 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Lyra assists) + 1d6 (Torvan assists) + Lyra's Lorekeeper bonus +1d6
- **Total pool: 4d6**
- Rolls: **[3, 4, 2, 5]**
- **Successes (3+): 3 successes** - STRONG SUCCESS!

---

**Result:**

> **Working together, you carefully realign the broken mechanism. Kael uses bits of stone rubble to wedge the wheels into position. Lyra calculates the correct angles. Torvan holds pieces steady while Kael secures them.**
>
> **The seventh lock... CLICKS.**
>
> **All seven locks begin turning on their own. Slow, grinding rotation. Each wheel aligns with the next.**
>
> **CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.**
>
> **Seven locks align. Seven foundations secured.**
>
> **The massive basalt door... opens.**
>
> **Not violently—smoothly, as if it's been waiting centuries for someone to arrive with the proper key: RESPECT.**
>
> **Beyond the door: Darkness. And a low, rhythmic HUM—the sound of Weave-energy flowing through stone channels.**

---

### Mechanical Observations - Playtest Notes:

✅ **Skill challenge worked well** - Lore → Craft sequence felt natural  
✅ **Team checks** (Assist actions) rewarded party cooperation  
✅ **Lorekeeper's Focus** feat provided meaningful bonus (identified mechanism, gained +1d6 advantage)  
✅ **Moderate difficulty (3+) with team effort = achievable but not trivial**  
⚠️ **Assist mechanics:** Need to clarify - do assistants' 1s burn their own HD? (Answer: Yes, any exertion dice burn HD on 1s)  

**SUCCESS: Door opens without triggering guardian hostility.**

---

## Scene 7: Beyond the Door (Session 1 Climax Tease)

> **The passage beyond is carved tunnel descending deeper. Glowing blue runes line the walls—ley-line conduits visible to naked eye. The HUM grows louder as you descend.**
>
> **After 50 yards, the tunnel opens into another chamber. This one is smaller—30 yards across—but ACTIVE.**
>
> **At the center: A LEY-NODE NEXUS.**
>
> **It looks like a crystalline pillar rising from floor to ceiling, 10 feet in diameter, pulsing with blue-white light. Arcs of magical energy spiral around it, crackling and unstable. The ground trembles every few seconds—each pulse sends vibrations through the stone.**
>
> **Around the perimeter: FOUR MORE GUARDIANS. Larger. More ornate. ELITE SENTINELS.**
>
> **They are active—patrolling the chamber in slow, deliberate circuits.**
>
> **They have NOT noticed you yet.**

---

### Decision Point: Session 1 Ends on Cliffhanger

**This is where Session 1 would end in a real game:**

- Party has successfully negotiated past first guardians
- Door puzzle solved through teamwork
- Ley-Node chamber discovered
- Boss encounter (Elite Sentinels) revealed
- Stakes clear: Stabilize the ley-node or catastrophic collapse

**Lyra would whisper:** "The ley-node is collapsing. Every pulse sends another quake. If we don't stabilize it... Stonebridge won't survive the week."

**Cliffhanger Question:** "How do you approach the chamber?"

**Session 1 END.**

## Post-Session Analysis

### Mechanics Tested

✅ **Social Duels/Influence Checks:**
- Torvan's Council speech (Advanced 3+, 2 successes) - **SUCCESS**
- Lyra's guardian diplomacy (Advanced 3+, 2 successes with advantage) - **SUCCESS**
- **Observation:** Advanced tier (3+, need 2 successes) is tight but achievable with clever play + advantages

✅ **Skill Challenges:**
- Investigation checks (Basic 2+) - **EASY for Prof 1**
- Craft/repair check (Moderate 3+) - **CHALLENGING but team effort succeeded**
- **Observation:** Moderate tier (3+, need varying successes) rewards teamwork

✅ **Resource Management:**
- No combat yet = **no HD burn, no Resolve checks**
- Party at full strength entering Session 2
- Affinity Dice earned (Torvan: 1 stored from Guardian sacrifice)

✅ **Role Distribution:**
- **Torvan:** Tank/leader (negotiated with Council, led social approach)
- **Lyra:** Lore expert (identified Khuldras, decoded locks, Weave Sight)
- **Kael:** Practical skills (read Durg's guilt, repaired mechanism)

✅ **CORRECTED: Armor temp HD mechanics**
- Armor dice rolled ONCE when donned (not re-rolled during rest)
- Long rest: Auto-restore to originally rolled value
- Short rest: Can attempt Craft/Medicine check to repair
- Session log updated to reflect correct mechanic

### Issues Identified

⚠️ **Proficiency 1 creates narrow success windows:**
- Average roll (1d6) = 3.5
- Advanced tier (3+ threshold, need 2 successes) = ~40% chance per die
- With Prof 1 + Exert 1 = 2d6, likely 0-1 successes → often fails Advanced checks
- **Design Question:** Is this intentional difficulty curve or too harsh at Level 2?

⚠️ **Assist mechanics need clarification:**
- Do helpers roll their own dice or just grant +1d6 to leader?
- If helpers roll, do their 1s burn their own HD?
- **Recommendation:** Clarify "Assist = grant +1d6 reliable die (doesn't burn HD)" vs "Assist = add your roll to leader's pool"

⚠️ **Guardian "intelligence" undefined:**
- How do constructs evaluate respect vs threat?
- What triggers combat vs tolerance?
- **Recommendation:** Add "Construct Behavior" section to GM Guide

✅ **Narrative Advantage as +1d6 worked well:**
- Kara's offering stone
- Durg's confession
- Torvald's extra gear
- **Feels earned, not arbitrary**

### Session Pacing

**Total estimated time: ~1.5 hours** (for real table)
- Scene 1-2 (Council argument + negotiation): 20 min
- Scene 3 (NPC interactions): 30 min
- Scene 4-5 (Descent + Guardian chamber): 20 min
- Scene 6-7 (Door puzzle + ley-node reveal): 20 min

✅ **Pacing felt good** - mix of social, exploration, puzzle-solving  
✅ **No combat yet builds tension** - Session 2 will test combat systems  
✅ **Cliffhanger ending** creates anticipation

### Character Spotlight Distribution

✅ **Torvan:** Council speech, leadership, protective instincts shown  
✅ **Lyra:** Lore identification, Weave Sight, puzzle-solving  
✅ **Kael:** Practical observation, Durg interview, wilderness expertise (minimal so far - will shine in combat/tracking)  

**Observation:** Kael hasn't had major spotlight yet. Session 2 combat should showcase Hunter's Strike and Mark Prey.

## Prepare for Session 2?

**Next session will test:**
- Combat mechanics (Elite Sentinels, multi-target spells, exertion burn, Resolve checks)
- Rush/Steady usage (if party takes damage)
- Resource depletion (HD burn from 1s, Resolve management)
- Death/dying states (if things go badly)
- Ranger's Mark Prey and battlefield control (Entangle spell)

**Should we continue to Session 2, or do you want to:**
1. Analyze Session 1 results first?
2. Adjust any mechanics based on observations?
3. Ask questions about specific interactions?
