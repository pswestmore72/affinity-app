## Scene 1: The Long Walk Back

### Narrative

> *The ley-node chamber behind you hums with stable, peaceful energy. The Warden stands dormant in its alcove, runes glowing soft blue. The tremors have stopped.*
>
> *Torvan looks down at his ruined armor—shield shattered, half-plate crumpled and useless. He gathers the pieces anyway.* "Maybe the smith can salvage something."
>
> *Kael shoulders his bow, eyes already on the tunnel ahead.* "Long walk back. Let's move before anything else wakes up."
>
> *Lyra clutches her journal, still scribbling notes as she walks.* "The inscriptions... the custodial protocols... this is INVALUABLE. Pre-Schism divine architecture, perfectly preserved..."
>
> *The three of you begin the journey back through Shaft #7.*

### The Journey (No Encounters)

**Distance:** ~1 mile through mining tunnels  
**Time:** ~30 minutes of careful navigation  
**Conditions:** Tunnels are stable now (no tremors), but still dark and oppressive

**Wilderness Check (Basic 2+)** — Navigate safely back through tunnels

**Kael uses Nature's Treaty (Passive):**
- Auto-succeeds all Basic tier Wilderness checks
- Party follows his lead without incident

> *Kael moves through the darkness with practiced ease, finding stable footing, avoiding loose rubble. The party emerges from Shaft #7 into the mining complex proper as the sun sets—orange light streaming through warehouse windows.*
>
> *Miners working the evening shift stop and stare. News travels fast.*

**Miner (calling out):** "Did you... did you fix it? The quakes stopped three hours ago!"

**Torvan:** "The temple is stable. Sealed properly this time."

> *A cheer erupts. Word spreads like wildfire.*

---

## Scene 2: The Miners' Rest (Evening Arrival)

### Narrative

> *By the time you reach the Miners' Rest tavern adjacent to The Delve, a crowd has gathered. Exhausted but hopeful faces. Families reunited with miners who'd fled. Children tugging on their parents' sleeves, asking if it's safe.*
>
> *The tavern keeper—a burly woman named Hilde—pushes through the crowd.* "You three look like you fought a mountain. Get inside. Food's on me."

**The party enters the Miners' Rest:**
- Rough establishment, sawdust floor, long tables
- Smells of stew, ale, and sweat
- ~40 miners and families packed inside
- Durg Blackiron sits alone in a corner booth, staring into his cup

### Immediate Needs Assessment

**Torvan's Armor:** Completely destroyed  
**Kael's HD:** 4/5 (minor wound from exertion burn)  
**Lyra's Magical Armor:** Will dissipate after 8 hours  
**Time:** 6:00 PM, sunset

**Options:**
1. **Eat and rest here overnight** (8+ hours = full Rest, Torvan can begin Recover)
2. **Push to Stonebridge tonight** (1 hour walk, arrive ~7:30 PM, report to Council)
3. **Split the difference** (eat here, rest briefly, travel at dawn)

### Party Decision: Rest Here Tonight

**Torvan:** "I can barely stand. This armor needs work, and I need sleep. Council can wait until morning."

**Kael:** Nods. "Warden isn't going anywhere. Let the town relax tonight. We'll make our report fresh."

**Lyra:** "I need to organize my notes anyway. A proper rest sounds wise."

**Hilde provides:**
- Private room upstairs (3 beds)
- Hot stew, bread, ale
- Basin and water for washing
- Stable cots

### Dinner Conversation (NPC Interaction 1: Durg Blackiron)

**Durg approaches their table:**

> *The dwarf looks haggard. Beard unkempt, eyes red-rimmed. He carries his mug and sits without asking.*
>
> **Durg:** "I heard you went down there. To the chamber. To... what I broke."
>
> *(Silence for a moment. He stares at his hands.)*
>
> **Durg:** "Four men died because of my greed. I thought there'd be treasure. Ancient gold. Lost artifacts. Instead, I woke something that nearly killed us all."
>
> *(He looks up, meeting Torvan's eyes.)*
>
> **Durg:** "Did you... did you see them? The guardians? The ones that crushed Henrik?"

**Influence Opportunity (Comfort/Condemn/Educate):**

Multiple approaches possible:
- **Torvan (Guardian affinity):** Forgiveness through sacrifice —"You made a mistake. Make it right through service."
- **Kael (Decay affinity):** Accept endings — "Henrik's death was necessary for the mine to survive. Grieve, but move forward."
- **Lyra (Memory affinity):** Preserve truth — "What matters is that we learn from this. Your mistake becomes a warning for others."

**Party chooses Lyra's approach:**

**Lyra:** "What you did was reckless, Durg. But what matters now is that the truth is preserved. You broke ancient seals—yes. But we can document WHY they were sealed, WHAT they protected, and ensure this never happens again. Your mistake becomes a lesson."

**Influence Check (Moderate 3+, 2 required)** — Ease Durg's guilt

**Lyra rolls:** 1d6 (Prof) + 0 (no exertion, conserving)
- **Roll:** [5] = 1 success
- **Not quite enough, but...**

**Torvan assists:**

**Torvan:** "You didn't know. But you can help rebuild what was lost. The council will need your knowledge of what you found. Stand with us tomorrow when we report."

**Torvan rolls (assist):** 1d6 (Prof)
- **Roll:** [4] = 1 success
- **Combined: 2 successes** ✅

**Success!**

> *Durg's shoulders slump—not in defeat, but in release. He nods slowly.*
>
> **Durg:** "I'll testify. Tell them everything. It's... it's the least I can do."
>
> *(He stands, steadier now.)*
>
> **Durg:** "Thank you. For going down there when I couldn't."
>
> *(He leaves, purpose in his step for the first time in weeks.)*

**Affinity Opportunity:**
- **Lyra:** Preserved truth and transformed guilt into purpose — **Memory affinity potential** (GM discretion: could award 2nd Affinity Die, or save for campaign end)
- **Torvan:** Protected someone vulnerable (Durg's spirit) — **Guardian affinity potential**

**GM Decision:** Save Affinity awards for Level 3 advancement discussion.

## Scene 3: Long Rest & Recover

### The Night (8 Hours)

**Time:** 7:00 PM → 3:00 AM (8 hours sleep)

**Rest Mechanics (8+ hours uninterrupted sleep):**
- Restore all HD
- Restore all Resolve
- Restore all Exertion Dice
- Regain all prepared spells
- Change prepared spells (if desired)

**Recover Mechanics (6+ hours safe, working on armor/gear):**
- Torvan can attempt to restore his armor layer
- Requires safe environment + time
- **Armor Recover Check (Basic 2+, 1 required):**
  - Roll Prof + Exertion (if pushing)
  - Success = restore armor layer to original state
  - Failure = armor remains depleted (must find smith or better materials)

### Torvan's Recover Attempt

**Torvan's approach:**
- Spend first 6 hours of rest working on armor
- Available materials: Ruined half-plate, broken shield, basic smithing tools from Hilde

**Craft/Repair Check (Basic 2+, 1 required)** — Restore armor

**Torvan rolls:** 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Exertion, he's willing to push)
- **Roll:** [3, 4] = 2 successes ✅
- **No 1s:** No HD burn
- **Success!**

> *Torvan spends the evening hammering, bending, patching. The half-plate won't be beautiful, but it'll hold. The shield is beyond repair—he salvages the straps for other gear.*
>
> *By midnight, he has functional armor again. Not pretty, but protective.*

**Torvan's Armor Restored:**
- 2d10 armor layer (half-plate repaired)
- Shield: **NOT RESTORED** (too damaged, needs dedicated shield or smith)

**Then Torvan sleeps (remaining 2 hours count toward Rest):**

**Full Party After 8-Hour Rest:**

| Character | HD | Resolve | Armor | Notes |
|-----------|-----|---------|-------|-------|
| Torvan | 5/5 d10 ✅ | 5/5 ✅ | 2d10 (repaired) | Shield still destroyed |
| Kael | 5/5 d8 ✅ | 5/5 ✅ | 2d8 (intact) | Fully rested |
| Lyra | 4/4 d6 ✅ | 5/5 ✅ | None (Magical Armor dissipated) | Can recast if needed |

## Scene 4: Morning — Return to Stonebridge

### Narrative (Dawn, 6:00 AM)

> *You wake to the first rays of sunlight through the tavern window. The Miners' Rest is quiet—most miners asleep after last night's celebration.*
>
> *Hilde has breakfast ready: Porridge, eggs, toast, strong tea.*
>
> *Through the window, you see Stonebridge in the distance. The town looks... different. Lighter. The tension that hung over it like smoke is gone.*

**Travel to Stonebridge:** 1 hour walk (easy road)

**Arrival: 7:00 AM**

> *The town is just waking. Shopkeepers opening shutters. Children playing in the square—no longer sheltering indoors. The Cragrun River flows peacefully under the stone bridge.*
>
> *Someone recognizes you.* "THEY'RE BACK! The ones who stopped the quakes!"
>
> *Word spreads faster than wildfire.*

---

## Scene 5: The Council Summons

### Narrative

> *Before you reach the Stonehammer Inn, a town guard jogs up—young man, out of breath.*
>
> **Guard:** "The Council wants to see you. Now. Town Hall. Captain Torvald sent me."
>
> *The crowd parts as you walk toward the Town Hall. Faces watch—hopeful, grateful, curious.*

### The Council Chamber (Official Report)

**Present:**
- **Captain Torvald Greystone** (Militia Captain) — stern but fair
- **Priestess Kara Ironshod** (Religious Representative) — eyes gleaming with scholarly interest
- **Mira Ashford** (Citizens' Representative) — relieved and grateful
- **Harlan Vex** (Merchant Guild) — calculating, already thinking economically
- **Durg Blackiron** (Mine Overseer, seated to the side) — subdued but present

**Audience:** ~30 townsfolk packed into the hall's public gallery

**Torvald:** "Report. What did you find beneath Shaft #7?"

### The Report (Influence/Persuasion Sequence)

**Party Goals:**
1. Explain what the temple is (Khuldras, ancient seals)
2. Describe the Warden and ley-node
3. Recommend future policy (seal permanently? study carefully? guard it?)
4. Exonerate Durg (or condemn him? Party's choice)

**Lyra takes the lead (Lore expert):**

**Lyra:** "We found the Hollow Below—an 800-year-old temple to Khuldras, the Deep Foundation. Pre-Schism architecture, perfectly preserved. The seals Durg broke weren't locks on treasure—they were CUSTODIAL PROTOCOLS. Safety measures to keep the temple's guardians dormant and its ley-node stable."

**Persuasion Check (Advanced 3+, 2 required)** — Convince Council of temple's significance

**Lyra rolls:** 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Exertion)
- **Roll:** [6, 3] = 3 successes! (Explosive 6)
- **No 1s:** No HD burn
- **Success!**

> *The Council leans forward. Kara's eyes are WIDE.*

**Kara:** "Khuldras? I've read fragmentary texts, but... an intact temple? The historical significance alone..."

**Harlan (practical):** "And the tremors? The danger?"

**Torvan steps in:**

**Torvan:** "The guardian construct—what we call the Warden—was awakened when the seals broke. It was following its programming: protect the ley-node at all costs. We found a way to override its hostility. It now guards the chamber peacefully. The ley-node has been stabilized through divine ritual."

**Persuasion Check (Moderate 3+, 2 required)** — Convince Council the danger is neutralized

**Torvan rolls:** 1d6 (Prof) + 0 (conserving)
- **Roll:** [2] = 0 successes
- **Not enough!**

**Torvald (skeptical):** "You 'talked it down'? A stone monster that killed Henrik Stonefoot?"

**Kael intervenes:**

**Kael:** "We didn't fight it. We understood it. The Warden isn't evil—it's a tool. A guardian doing its job. Breaking the seals made US the threat in its eyes. We proved we were there to HELP, not desecrate. It stood down."

**Persuasion Check (Moderate 3+, 2 required)** — Reinforce the message

**Kael rolls:** 1d6 (Prof) + 1d6 (Exertion, he's willing to commit)
- **Roll:** [5, 2] = 2 successes ✅
- **No 1s:** No HD burn
- **Success!**

> *Torvald's expression softens—barely, but it's there.*

**Torvald:** "The tremors HAVE stopped. And if you're standing here alive, you clearly handled it."

**Mira (hopeful):** "So... the mine can reopen?"

**Lyra:** "Carefully. Shaft #7 should be sealed—not collapsed, but LOCKED. With proper warning inscriptions. The rest of the mine is safe. The Delve can operate, but no one goes into the temple without divine authority or scholarly oversight."

**Kara nods emphatically:** "I'll draft the warning inscriptions myself. In three languages."

### The Durg Question

**Harlan (coldly):** "And what of Durg's actions? He violated protocol, broke ancient seals, got four men killed. Where's the accountability?"

**Silence in the chamber.**

**Party chooses defense:**

**Lyra:** "Durg made a mistake born of ignorance, not malice. He's willing to testify, to share what he learned, to help prevent this from ever happening again. Punish him if you must—but don't waste the knowledge he gained."

**Torvan:** "He carries the guilt of those deaths. That's punishment enough. Let him serve. Let him rebuild."

**Influence Check (Advanced 3+, 2 required)** — Sway Council toward leniency

**Lyra + Torvan (combined effort):**
- Lyra: 1d6 → [4] = 1 success
- Torvan: 1d6 → [6] = 2 successes (Explosive)
- **Total: 3 successes** ✅

> *Mira speaks first:* "My husband worked with Durg for ten years. He's a good man who made a terrible mistake. If he's willing to make amends..."
>
> *Torvald crosses his arms.* "Suspended from Mine Overseer. Demoted to supervisor. He works under someone else's authority for the next year. And he testifies fully about what was found."
>
> *Kara adds:* "And he assists with the warning inscriptions. His knowledge ensures accuracy."
>
> *Harlan looks like he wants to argue, but he's outvoted. He grimaces.* "Fine. But if there's another incident, it's on all of you."

**Durg (standing, voice shaking):** "Thank you. I... I won't waste this chance."

**Magical/Unique:**

**Kara Ironshod approaches after the meeting:**

> **Kara:** "Lyra. Your documentation of the temple—may I see it?"
>
> *(Lyra hands over her journal. Kara flips through pages, eyes widening.)*
>
> **Kara:** "This is... extraordinary. Pre-Schism divine theory, custodial protocols, ley-node stabilization... I have something for you."
>
> *(She pulls a small carved stone from her robes—similar to the offering stone, but different. Etched with runes.)*
>
> **Kara:** "A **Runestone of Khuldras**. Minor artifact, but precious. It resonates with earth and stability. You've earned it."

---

**Torvan receives: Guard's Shield (Common/Basic Item)**
- **Effect:** 1d12 armor layer (shield, replaces destroyed shield)
- **Quality:** Superior craftsmanship (+1 to first defense roll each combat, doesn't stack, doesn't burn HD)

**Torvan's Armor Now:** 2d10 (half-plate) + 1d12 (Guard's Shield)

---

**Mira approaches Kael:**

> **Mira:** "The miners say you guided them when panic hit during the first tremor. Kept them calm. Told them when it was safe to continue. Ranger's instincts."
>
> *(She hands him a leather pouch—heavy with coin.)*
>
> **Mira:** "This isn't from the Council fund. It's from the miners themselves. They wanted you to have it."

**Kael receives: 100 gold pieces (extra, from miners' gratitude)**

---

## Scene 7: The Stonehammer Inn (Celebration)

### Narrative (Evening, 6:00 PM)

> *Word spread fast. By evening, the Stonehammer Inn is PACKED. Music, laughter, ale flowing freely. The tremors are over. The mine reopens tomorrow. Stonebridge LIVES.*
>
> *The party sits at the place of honor—center table, near the hearth. Townsfolk toast them, miners clap Torvan's back, children ask Lyra about "the stone giant."*
>
> *For the first time in weeks, Stonebridge feels like HOME.*

**Affinity Opportunities (Final Check):**

**Torvan:** Protected Durg (vulnerable), stood as defender before Council, received Guard's Shield (symbol of protection) — **Guardian affinity fulfilled?**

**Kael:** Guided the panic during tremor (Session 1), accepted necessary ending of Henrik's death (Durg conversation), helped town move forward — **Decay affinity fulfilled?**

**Lyra:** Preserved Khuldras knowledge (Session 2), documented temple fully, influenced Council with truth — **Memory affinity already fulfilled (1 stored)**

- Lyra: 1 stored (earned Session 2)

---

## Session 3 Playtest Analysis

### Mechanics Tested

✅ **Rest System:**
- 8-hour Rest successfully restored all HD, Resolve, spell slots
- Clear, simple to track
- Felt meaningful after depleting resources in Session 2

✅ **Recover System:**
- Torvan's armor restoration (6+ hours, Basic check) worked smoothly
- Required narrative commitment (time + safe space)
- Shield couldn't be restored (too damaged) — felt appropriate
- **Observation:** Recover provides tactical choice (spend time to restore armor OR push forward depleted)

✅ **Social Influence System:**
- Multiple Influence checks (Durg, Council report, leniency plea)
- Moderate 3+ and Advanced 3+ felt appropriate for social stakes
- Party coordination (multiple PCs contributing) felt natural
- **Success:** Convinced Council, cleared Durg, shaped policy

✅ **Affinity Die Rewards:**
- Torvan: Guardian (protected Durg's spirit, served as defender)
- Kael: Decay (helped town accept endings, move toward renewal)
- Lyra: Memory (already earned in Session 2)
- **Felt earned, not arbitrary**

✅ **Level Advancement:**
- Milestone system (3 sessions = Level 3) felt appropriate
- Proficiency 1 → 2 increases power meaningfully:
  - Exertion budget: 1 → 2 (double the tactical options)
  - More spells known/prepared (Rangers/Weavers)
  - Better success rates on checks
- **Observation:** Level 3 feels like "competent adventurer" tier

✅ **Reward Structure:**
- Gold (500g split) — practical
- Magic items (Runestone, Guard's Shield) — thematic and useful
- Social rewards (reputation, free lodging, Council favor) — meaningful
- **No +1 swords** — stayed true to system philosophy

### Issues Identified

✅ **Social Encounters Flow Well:**
- Party naturally divided responsibilities (Lyra lore, Torvan protection, Kael guidance)
- NPC threads (Durg, Kara, Harlan, Torvald) tied to character affinities
- **Recommendation:** More campaigns should include social/political sessions between dungeon crawls

⚠️ **Rest/Recover Clarity:**
- Rest (8h) vs Recover (6h) could be confused
- **Recommendation:** Add sidebar in rules clarifying: "Rest = restore resources, Recover = repair gear"

✅ **Milestone Leveling Works:**
- 3 sessions = 1 level (for Levels 2-3) felt right
- Gave time to test mechanics before increasing complexity
- **Recommendation:** Slower leveling at higher tiers (5+ sessions per level at Levels 8+)

---

## Prepare for Future Adventures?

**The Hollow Below Campaign: COMPLETE** ✅

**Potential Future Hooks:**
1. **The Khuldras Expedition:** Kara wants to explore other Pre-Schism sites
2. **Stonebridge Militia:** Torvald offers the party positions as special forces
3. **Merchant Escort:** Harlan needs protection for valuable ore shipments
4. **Open World:** Party leaves Stonebridge as wandering heroes

**Party is now Level 3, battle-tested, and ready for greater challenges.**

---

*The town sleeps peacefully. The Warden guards its temple. And three heroes dream of what comes next.* ⚔️📖✨
