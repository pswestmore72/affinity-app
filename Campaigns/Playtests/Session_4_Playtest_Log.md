## Scene 1: Kara's Request (One Week Later)

### Narrative

> *Seven days have passed since you stabilized the ley-node. Stonebridge has returned to normalcy—The Delve operates at full capacity (avoiding Shaft #7), tremors are gone, and the town breathes easy.*
>
> *You've spent the week resting at the Stonehammer Inn. Free room and board, courtesy of a grateful town. Torvan has been training with the militia in the mornings. Kael has been scouting the surrounding hills. Lyra has been organizing her notes on Khuldras.*
>
> *This morning, Priestess Kara Ironshod arrives at your table during breakfast. She's practically vibrating with excitement.*

**Kara:** "I need your help. Again. Different help this time—not life-or-death. Well, probably not. Hopefully not."

> *She spreads scroll after scroll across the table—sketches, rubbings, translations.*

**Kara:** "I've been studying everything you told me about the temple. The inscriptions, the Warden, the ley-node stabilization. But there are GAPS. Huge gaps. The outer sanctum you entered—that's just the BEGINNING. Pre-Schism temples to earth deities always had deeper levels. Meditation chambers. Vaults. Archives."

> *She looks at each of you with scholarly intensity.*

**Kara:** "I want to properly document the Hollow Below. Map it. Translate the inscriptions. Understand Khuldras's theology before it's lost forever. But I can't do it alone, and the Council won't fund another expedition without... insurance."

**Torvan:** "Insurance meaning us."

**Kara:** "Exactly. You've proven you can handle whatever's down there. I need guides. Protectors. Witnesses."

**What Kara Offers:**
- **No monetary payment** (the party doesn't need gold, but she doesn't know that)
- **Access to her temple's library** (religious lore, historical texts)
- **Divine blessings** (she can cast blessings/buffs before dangerous encounters)
- **She'll teach you something** (Path advancement opportunity—see below)
- **Academic glory** (Lyra's name on the published documentation)

**Party Decision Point:** Accept or decline

### Torvan's Consideration

**Torvan:** "The Warden is stable. We left it guarding the sanctum peacefully. Going deeper could wake something else."

**Kara:** "Or it could teach us HOW to keep it asleep. Knowledge prevents future disasters. Isn't that what Guardians do? Protect through preparation?"

**Guardian Affinity Moment:** Kara's argument resonates—protecting Stonebridge long-term requires understanding what's beneath it.

### Kael's Assessment

**Kael:** "Sealed temples usually stay sealed for a reason. Dead civilizations, forgotten gods... things end because they're meant to."

**Kara:** "But the temple ISN'T dead. The ley-node is active. The Warden still functions. This isn't an ending—it's a pause. Understanding the pause prevents another reckless fool from breaking it."

**Decay Affinity Moment:** Fair point—helping the temple's legacy transition properly (from forgotten to documented) honors necessary endings while preventing needless destruction.

### Lyra's Excitement

**Lyra:** "When do we leave?"

> *Kara grins.*

**Kara:** "Tomorrow morning. I've arranged for militia guards to secure the Shaft #7 entrance. We'll have the site to ourselves."

---

---

### Torvan's Path Advancement

## Scene 3: Return to the Hollow Below

### Narrative (Morning, Shaft #7)

> *Dawn breaks cold and clear. You meet Kara at the Delve's entrance. Two militia guards nod as you pass—they'll hold the surface.*
>
> *The descent down Shaft #7 is familiar now. 200 feet through worked tunnels, then the breached wall into the Antechamber.*
>
> *The temple chamber looks different in daylight filtering from above. The pillars cast long shadows. The great basalt door stands open.*
>
> *And in the alcove beyond, the Warden rests. Dormant. Runes glowing soft blue.*

**Kara stops, staring.**

**Kara:** "By the Craftmaker... it's beautiful. Pre-Schism custodial architecture. I've only seen sketches."

> *She approaches the Warden slowly, reverently. It doesn't move, but its head tilts slightly—tracking her.*

**Kara (to the Warden):** "I come to learn, not to harm. To preserve your purpose."

> *The Warden remains still. Accepting.*

**Kara turns to the party:** "The ley-node chamber is behind us. But look—there." 

> *She points to the chamber's far wall, opposite the entrance. Partially hidden behind a pillar: ANOTHER doorway. Smaller, carved with different runes.*

**Kara:** "That wasn't in your description. Did you explore past the ley-node room?"

**Party:** "No—we stabilized the node and left."

**Kara:** "Then that's where we're going. Deeper levels. The temple's true secrets."

---

## Scene 4: The Archive Entrance (Puzzle Challenge)

### Narrative

> *The secondary door is 8 feet tall, carved from the same black basalt. Unlike the main entrance (which was forcibly opened), this door is SEALED with a different mechanism:*
>
> *Seven gemstones set in a circular pattern around a central lock. Each gem glows faintly—blue, green, red, yellow, white, black, and violet.*
>
> *Runes surround the circle: Pre-Schism Khuldric script.*

**Kara (examining):** "This is a knowledge-lock. Not meant to keep people out—meant to ensure only the WORTHY enter. Priests who understood the faith."

**Investigation Check (Moderate 3+, 2 required)** — Examine the door mechanism

**Lyra rolls:** 2d6 (Prof 2) + 0 (conserving)
- **Roll:** [5, 3] = 2 successes ✅
- **Success!**

> *Lyra studies the runes and gem pattern. Her Memory affinity stirs—she's seen similar structures in other ancient sites (though different deities).*

**Lyra:** "It's a theological cipher. Each gem represents an aspect of Khuldras's domain. We need to press them in the correct order—the order of creation according to Khuldras's cosmology."

**Lore Check (Advanced 3+, 2 required)** — Recall or deduce Khuldras theology

**Kara rolls (she's the expert):** 2d6 (Prof 2 as Level 2 Priest)
- **Roll:** [6, 4] = 3 successes! (Explosive 6) ✅
- **Success!**

**Kara:** "Khuldras is the Deep Foundation—earth and stability. The theology emphasizes layers, from formless void to structured reality."

> *She traces the pattern:*

**The Correct Sequence:**

1. **Black** (The Void Before) — Darkness before creation
2. **White** (First Light) — Consciousness emerges
3. **Blue** (Water/Foundation) — First element, depth and pressure
4. **Green** (Earth/Growth) — Land emerges, stability forms
5. **Yellow** (Structure/Order) — Civilization, purpose, temples
6. **Red** (Life/Warmth) — Fire of spirit, passion, preservation
7. **Violet** (Eternal Memory) — Knowledge preserved, legacy honored

**Kara presses each gem in sequence. Each glows brighter as she touches it.**

> *Click. Click. Click. Seven in sequence.*
>
> *The central lock TURNS on its own. The door swings inward, silent despite its weight.*
>
> *Beyond: Darkness. Stone steps descending.*

**Kara:** "The Archive awaits."

---

## Scene 5: The Archive of Foundations (Exploration)

### Narrative

> *The staircase descends 50 feet into a vast chamber. As your torchlight spreads, you see:*
>
> *Shelves carved directly from the stone walls—hundreds of them, stretching 30 feet high. Each shelf holds stone tablets, crystal spheres, metal scrolls. Some glow faintly with preservation magic.*
>
> *The chamber is circular, 60 yards across. In the center: a reading podium with a single open book made of thin stone pages.*
>
> *The air is DRY—magic preserves everything. No dust. No decay. Frozen in time.*

**Kara (breathless):** "This is... this is an intact Pre-Schism theological archive. Do you understand what this MEANS? Most were destroyed during the Sundering. This is..."

> *She trails off, too overwhelmed.*

**Lyra:** "Priceless. Irreplaceable. A window into lost history."

### What's in the Archive

**Investigation/Lore montage:**

The party spends an hour carefully exploring while Kara documents everything:

**Discoveries:**

**1. Khuldras's Theology (Religious Texts):**
- Stone tablets describing creation myths
- Hymns carved in musical notation (pre-verbal language)
- Ritual instructions for temple maintenance
- **Key Find:** Instructions for emergency ley-node stabilization (what Lyra did instinctively was actually CORRECT per ancient protocol)

**2. Custodial Constructs (Technical Documentation):**
- Blueprints for creating Sentinel Guardians
- Programming instructions (custodial protocols)
- Maintenance schedules (the Warden was designed to function for millennia)
- **Key Find:** Override commands—written authorization codes to command guardians

**3. Historical Records (Civilization Archive):**
- Population records of the mountain civilization
- Trade agreements with other Pre-Schism kingdoms (now extinct)
- Disaster logs—earthquakes, floods, and how Khuldras worship helped mitigate them
- **Key Find:** Final entry from 800 years ago: *"The surface kingdoms fall to Schism. We seal ourselves below. May the Deep Foundation protect our legacy until the world remembers stability."*

**4. Maps (Chamber Layouts):**
- Full temple schematics carved in 3D relief on a stone table
- Shows the outer sanctum, ley-node chamber, Archive (current location)
- **AND:** Two more levels below—Meditation Crypts and the Vault of Stillness

**Lyra (examining the map):** "There's more. Two levels deeper."

**Kara:** "The Meditation Crypts—where priests would undergo trials. And the Vault... that's where the temple's most sacred relics were kept."

**Kael:** "Sealed relics. In a sealed temple. In a civilization that vanished 800 years ago."

**Torvan:** "That's where the REAL danger is, isn't it?"

**Kara:** "Possibly. But also potentially the greatest treasures—artifacts, knowledge, power tied to Khuldras directly."

### The Choice

**Party Decision:**
1. **Leave the Archive documented, return to surface** (safe, ends session here)
2. **Descend to Meditation Crypts** (continue exploration, moderate danger)
3. **Push all the way to Vault of Stillness** (maximum risk, maximum reward)

**Party chooses: Descend to Meditation Crypts**

---

## Scene 6: The Meditation Crypts (Environmental Challenge)

### Narrative

> *The stairs from the Archive descend another 100 feet. The air grows colder. Your breath mists.*
>
> *At the bottom: A chamber unlike the ornate Archive. This is STARK. Twelve alcoves carved into the walls, each containing a stone meditation platform. Empty.*
>
> *But the floor... the floor is danger.*

**The Challenge:** The floor is covered in pressure-plate tiles. A maze of safe paths and trapped tiles.

**Investigation Check (Moderate 3+):**

**Kael rolls (Ranger's trap sense):** 2d6 + 1d6 (using Mark Prey on environmental hazard—creative use)
- **Roll:** [4, 5, 2] = 2 successes ✅

> *Kael studies the floor pattern. Some tiles are slightly lower—pressure plates. Others have tiny rune marks.*

**Kael:** "Trapped floor. Step wrong, something bad happens."

**Kara:** "This was a test of faith and focus. Initiates had to navigate while meditating—eyes closed, minds on divine truth."

**The Puzzle:**

The safe path creates a PATTERN when viewed from above—it traces Khuldras's creation sequence symbol (same as the door lock earlier).

**How to Solve:**
1. **Easy Way:** Lyra recognizes the pattern from the door puzzle (no check, just player deduction)
2. **Hard Way:** Trial and error (step carefully, trigger traps, learn the path)

**Lyra (Memory affinity moment):** "Wait. The pattern. It's the same sequence as the archive door—Black, White, Blue, Green, Yellow, Red, Violet."

> *She traces it with her finger from above. The safe tiles align perfectly.*

**Kara:** "Brilliant! The theology is EMBEDDED in the architecture!"

### Crossing Safely

**Group Acrobatics Check (Basic 2+)** — Follow Lyra's guidance across the pattern

**Success:** Party crosses without triggering traps

**If they trigger a trap anyway (1s rolled or deliberate testing):**

> *CLICK. The tile depresses. From the walls: Stone panels slide open. Darts shoot across the chamber!*

**Dexterity Save (Moderate 3+):**
- **Fail:** 2 HD damage from dart barrage
- **Success:** Dodge successfully

---

## Scene 7: The Vault of Stillness (Boss Treasure Room)

### Narrative

> *Beyond the Meditation Crypts: The final door. This one is not puzzled—it's simply sealed with heavy stone bars.*
>
> *Bas-reliefs cover the door: Khuldras depicted as a massive figure of stone, holding the world on broad shoulders. Eyes closed. Eternal. Still.*
>
> *Above the door, carved in Old Khuldric:*
>
> **"Only the Worthy May Bear the Foundation's Burden."**

**Strength Check (Moderate 3+, 2 required)** — Lift the stone bars

**Torvan + Kael combined:**
- Torvan: 2d6 → [5, 4] = 2 successes
- Kael assists: 2d6 → [6, 3] = 3 successes
- **Total: 5 successes** ✅

> *With both of you straining, the bars lift. Ancient mechanisms click. The door swings open.*
>
> *Inside: A small chamber, 20x20 feet. Bare except for a central stone altar.*
>
> *On the altar: Three items, preserved perfectly.*

### The Sacred Relics

**1. The Cornerstone Amulet** (Basic Magical Item)
- Carved stone pendant on a chain of iron links
- **Effect:** Wearer gains +2d6 to resist being moved (forced movement, grappling, etc.)
- **Passive:** Immune to tremors and earthquake effects
- **Narrative:** Symbol of Khuldras's stability

**2. The Testament of Foundations** (Artifact/Lore)
- Stone book, pages thin as parchment but hard as diamond
- Contains complete Khuldras theology, prayers, rituals
- **Effect (Priest/Divine Caster):** Can learn one Divine spell from this book (up to Expert tier)
- **Effect (Lyra - Memory Affinity):** Permanent +1d6 to all Lore checks involving history, religion, or ancient civilizations (doesn't burn HD)
- **Narrative:** The faith made tangible

**3. The Warden's Command Seal** (Advanced Magical Item)
- Stone seal carved with custodial override runes
- **Effect:** Once per long rest, issue a command to any custodial construct (Sentinel Guardians, Warden, etc.). They must obey one simple instruction (10 words or less) if it doesn't contradict core programming
- **Narrative:** Divine authority over temple guardians

### The Guardian Test

As the party approaches the altar:

> *The chamber RUMBLES. Not a quake—something activating.*
>
> *From alcoves you didn't notice: Two more Sentinel Guardians step forward. Smaller than the main entrance guardians—6 feet tall instead of 8—but still formidable.*
>
> *They don't attack. They... wait.*

**Kara:** "A test. They're evaluating whether we're worthy to take the relics."

**The Test:** Demonstrate understanding of Khuldras's virtues

**Three Virtues (from the Archive discovery):**
1. **Stability** — Remain steadfast under pressure
2. **Foundation** — Support others; be the ground they stand on
3. **Memory** — Preserve truth; honor the past

**How to Pass:**

Each party member must demonstrate ONE virtue through action or declaration:

**Torvan (Stability):**
- **Torvan:** "I stood between the Council and Durg when he faced judgment. I held steady when the Warden attacked. I guard those who cannot guard themselves. I AM stability."
- **Guardian nods once.** ✅

**Kael (Foundation):**
- **Kael:** "I helped this town find solid ground after tragedy. Guided them through darkness. Helped them build on loss. I provide foundation."
- **Guardian nods once.** ✅

**Lyra (Memory):**
- **Lyra:** "I documented this temple. Preserved your faith. Honored Khuldras when others forgot. I AM your memory."
- **Guardian nods once.** ✅

**Kara (all three):**
- **Kara (kneeling):** "I am Kara Ironshod, Priestess of Murien, but I honor ALL gods of craft and creation. Khuldras, your temple will not be forgotten. I will teach your faith. Preserve your truth. Build your legacy."
- **Both Guardians kneel.** ✅✅✅

> *The guardians step aside. The altar's surface glows faintly.*
>
> *You are PERMITTED to take the relics.*

---

## Scene 8: Distribution of Relics

**Party Discussion:**

**The Cornerstone Amulet:**
- Best for: Torvan (front-line tank, benefits from anti-movement)
- **Torvan accepts it.** Puts it on. Feels... grounded.

**The Testament of Foundations:**
- Best for: Lyra (Memory affinity, Lore specialist) OR Kara (Divine caster)
- **Lyra and Kara agree to share it**—Kara will copy it for religious purposes, Lyra will study it for historical knowledge
- **Lyra gains the permanent +1d6 Lore bonus** (Memory affinity reward)

**The Warden's Command Seal:**
- Best for: Shared party resource, carried by diplomat/leader
- **Torvan carries it** (Guardian = protector, makes thematic sense)

---

## Scene 9: The Return (Encounter on the Way Out)

### Narrative

> *You ascend from the Vault, relics in hand, Kara practically glowing with scholarly joy.*
>
> *As you pass through the Meditation Crypts—*
>
> *A sound. Behind you. From the darkness BELOW the Vault.*
>
> *Grinding stone. Footsteps. HEAVY.*

**Perception Check (Basic 2+):**

**Kael rolls:** 2d6 + 1d6 (Tracker instincts)
- **Roll:** [6, 3, 2] = 3 successes

> *Kael spins.* "Something's coming. Big. From deeper down."

**Kara (pale):** "There's nothing below the Vault on the map. The temple should END there."

**Lyra:** "Unless the map wasn't complete. Or something was deliberately left off."

**From the darkness:**

> *A figure emerges. Ten feet tall. Carved from obsidian, not basalt. Runes glow CRIMSON, not blue.*
>
> *Its face is not blank—it has features. A stern, bearded visage. Judging.*
>
> *It speaks. Voice like grinding mountains:*

**Voice:** "THIEVES. DEFILERS. YOU TAKE WHAT IS NOT YOURS."

**This is NOT a custodial guardian. This is a TEMPLE SENTINEL—older, more powerful, judgment-focused.**

**Arbiter:** "THEN... FORGIVENESS. I AM PROGRAMMED TO DESTROY THIEVES. BUT YOU ARE NOT THIEVES."

> *The crimson runes shift to blue.*

**Arbiter:** "YOU BEAR KHULDRAS'S GIFTS. USE THEM WELL. HONOR THE FOUNDATION."

>
> *Durg Blackiron stands at the back, listening. When Kara finishes, he approaches you.*

**Durg:** "You went back. Found the truth. Honored what I almost destroyed. I... thank you."

## Session 4 Playtest Analysis

### Mechanics Tested

✅ **Paths System:**
- Each character gained Novice tier in chosen Path (1/3 progress)
- Paths felt meaningful and thematic (Torvan = Sentinel, Kael = Tracker, Lyra = Ritualist)
- Guardian's Mark (Torvan) saw immediate tactical use (intercept attack)
- Swift Ritual (Lyra) will enable faster utility casting
- Relentless Hunter (Kael) will shine in tracking/pursuit scenarios
- **Feels:** Character customization without overwhelming complexity

✅ **Gear Restoration (No Gold):**
- Torvan's armor destroyed twice (combat consequence)
- Replaced during Recover with no gold cost (assumed availability)
- **Feels:** Appropriate—armor breaks, towns have smiths, heroes get equipped
- Removes bookkeeping, focuses on adventure

✅ **Puzzle Challenges:**
- Theological cipher (Archive door) rewarded lore knowledge
- Meditation Crypt floor trap rewarded pattern recognition
- Vault guardian test rewarded roleplay and virtue demonstration
- **Feels:** Balanced between combat and problem-solving

✅ **Diplomacy in Combat:**
- Party convinced Obsidian Arbiter mid-combat (Persuasion + Religion checks)
- Ended boss fight through roleplaying rather than HP depletion
- **Feels:** Rewarding player creativity, not just dice pools

✅ **Environmental Narrative:**
- Archive preservation magic (no decay, frozen time) created atmosphere
- Meditation Crypts trap floor built tension
- Vault simplicity (bare altar, three relics) focused attention
- **Feels:** Each area had distinct identity

✅ **Sacred Relics Distribution:**
- Three items for three characters felt fair
- Each relic tied to temple theme (stability, memory, authority)
- No conflict over loot—thematic fit clear
- **Feels:** Rewards enhance character concepts, not just power

### Issues Identified

⚠️ **Path Advancement Pacing:**
- Gained only 1 point this session (1/3 progress)
- At this rate, reaching Adept (2 points) takes 2 sessions, Expert (3 points) takes 3 sessions
- **Recommendation:** Consider awarding 1 point per major milestone OR allow training during long downtime
- **Current Feel:** Slow but deliberate

✅ **Boss Encounter Balance:**
- Obsidian Arbiter at 30 HD felt appropriate for Level 3 party
- Obsidian Armor (-2 first hit) created tactical challenge (focus fire vs spread damage)
- Diplomacy option prevented slog
- **Observation:** Arbiter would have been BRUTAL if forced to fight to 0 HD (would take 4-5 rounds minimum, severe attrition)

✅ **Torvan Armor Depletion:**
- Lost shield + armor in 2 attacks (4 HD + 3 HD)
- Defense Capacity 1 at Prof 2 still very limiting
- **Feels:** Appropriate fragility—armor is ablative, combat is dangerous
- Guardian's Mark ability creates meaningful tank choice (protect allies at cost to self)

✅ **Affinity Dice Not Used:**
- Party had combined 4 Affinity Dice stored
- Didn't spend any this session
- **Observation:** Players hoarding for "critical moment"
- **Design Question:** Is this okay, or should there be incentives to spend?

### Narrative Observations

**What Worked:**
- Kara as enthusiastic scholar NPC created energy and purpose
- Discovering temple levels deeper than expected built mystery
- Relics as rewards felt thematic and earned
- Durg's redemption arc (offering to Khuldras) provided emotional payoff

**What Could Improve:**
- More environmental hazards in Crypts (only trap floor)
- Archive could have had MORE interactive elements (crystal spheres, animated texts)
- Arbiter arrival was sudden—could telegraph with warning signs earlier

### Recommendations

**For Session 5:**
- Introduce the "level below the Vault" (Arbiter's origin)
- Final confrontation or revelation about Khuldras's true purpose
- Award final Path point (bringing everyone to 2/3)
- Consider Level 4 advancement if campaign continues beyond Session 5

**For System:**
- Consider Path advancement rate: 1 point per session may be too slow for shorter campaigns
- Gear restoration clarity: Add sidebar in rules "During Recover in civilization, standard equipment freely available"
- Defensive abilities (Guardian's Mark) create interesting tank gameplay

## 🛡️ POST-SESSION RULE UPDATE

**DEFENSE CAPACITY FORMULA CHANGED (February 16, 2026)**

Based on Session 4 observations and analysis, the Defense Capacity formula has been updated systemwide:

**OLD FORMULA (used in Sessions 1-4):**  
Defense Capacity = ½ Proficiency (rounded up, minimum 1)
- Prof 1-2: 1 roll per attack
- Prof 3-4: 2 rolls per attack
- Prof 5-6: 3 rolls per attack

**NEW FORMULA (starting Session 5):**  
Defense Capacity = Proficiency (full value)
- Prof 1: 1 roll per attack
- Prof 2: 2 rolls per attack
- Prof 3: 3 rolls per attack
- Prof 4: 4 rolls per attack
- Prof 5-6: 5-6 rolls per attack

**Impact on Current Party (Prof 2):**
- Torvan: 1 roll → **2 rolls** per attack
- Kael: 1 roll → **2 rolls** per attack
- Lyra: 1 roll → **2 rolls** per attack

**Rationale:**
- Creates "blow for blow" combat feel (defending multiple times per attack = trading strikes)
- Doesn't create dice slog (most attacks 2-4 HD, most defenses 2-4 rolls = quick resolution)
- Clean math (no halving, no rounding)
- Rewards heavy armor investment (multiple rolls benefit layered defense)
- Still allows armor destruction (just takes 2-3 hits instead of instant overwhelm)

**Session 5 will test this updated formula.**
