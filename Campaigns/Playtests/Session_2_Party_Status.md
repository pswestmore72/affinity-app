## Post-Session 2 Status

### Torvan Steelhand (Combatant, Level 2)

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| HD | 5/5 d10 | Full (healed by Lyra post-combat) |
| Resolve | 5/5 | Untouched this session |
| Armor | **0 (DESTROYED)** | Needs 6+ hours Recover to restore armor + shield |
| Affinity Dice | 1 | Guardian sacrifice roleplay (Session 1) |

**Session 2 Combat Log (CORRECTED MECHANICS):**
- Round 1: Took 3 HD damage from Warden's Stone Fist
  - Defense: Rolled 1d12 shield (success, absorbing 1 HD)
  - Shield destroyed (1d12 → 0), 1 armor die lost (2d10 → 1d10)
  - Body HD untouched (still 5d10)
- Round 2: Took 3 HD damage from Warden's Stone Fist (debuffed by War Cry)
  - Defense: Rolled 1d10 armor (success, absorbing 1 HD)
  - Remaining armor destroyed (1d10 → 0), 1 body die lost (5d10 → 4d10)
- Post-Combat: Healed 4 HD by Lyra's Seal Minor Wound (4d10 → 5d10 restored)

**Lessons Learned:**
- War Cry intimidation effectively debuffed Warden (-1d6 on attack)
- Armor is ablative — depletes die-by-die over multiple rounds
- Defense Capacity 1 = only 1 roll per attack, rest auto-fail
- Shield + armor provided 3+ rounds of protection before body took damage

### Kael Thornbrook (Ranger, Level 2)

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| HD | 4/5 d8 | Lost 1 HD to exertion burn (Round 2) |
| Resolve | 5/5 | Untouched this session |
| Armor | 2d8 (intact) | Never targeted |
| Affinity Dice | 0 | None gained this session |

**Session 2 Combat Log (CORRECTED MECHANICS):**
- Round 1: Mark Prey (success), Longbow attack (3 HD damage - 1 Stone Skin = 2 HD dealt)
  - Warden defended: Rolled 1d10 armor (success, absorbing 1 HD)
  - Warden armor: 2d10 → 1d10 (1 die lost)
- Round 2: Longbow attack (2 HD - 1 Stone Skin = 1 HD dealt), burned 1 HD from exertion 1
  - Warden defended: Rolled 1d10 armor (success, absorbing 1 HD)
  - No damage dealt (Warden armor held)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Mark Prey +1d6 bonus is valuable, doesn't risk HD burn
- Stone Skin (-1 HD) + Defense Capacity makes Warden tough
- Warden gets fresh Defense Capacity rolls per attack (not per round)
- Need concentrated attacks or high single-hit damage to overwhelm defenses

### Lyra Ashveil (Weaver, Level 2)

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| HD | 4/4 d6 | Full |
| Resolve | 5/5 | Untouched |

| Affinity Dice | 0 → 1 | **EARNED THIS SESSION** (see below) |

**Session 2 Combat Log:**

**Lessons Learned:**
