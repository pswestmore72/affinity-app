## The City of Korshal

Before diving into the campaign, establish Korshal's character—it's not just a backdrop, but a living entity.

### Geography & Layout

**Korshal** sprawls across both banks of the **Silverrun River** where three ancient trade roads converge. Population: ~40,000. The city grew organically over centuries, resulting in winding streets, hidden alleys, and layers of construction. Old ruins lie beneath newer buildings—particularly in the Undercroft.

**The Five Districts:**

**1. The Merchant Quarter** (North Bank, Upper City)
- **Character:** Wealth on display, golden-roofed buildings, private guards
- **Architecture:** Stone manors, walled compounds, manicured gardens
- **Population:** Merchant-lords, successful traders, hired muscle
- **Key Locations:**
  - **Kaine Manor**: Three-story fortified estate, east edge of district
  - **Koine's Mercantile**: Largest trading house, Kaine's "legitimate" business
  - **The Golden Scales**: High-end inn where deals are made
  - **Merchant's Plaza**: Auction house for rare goods, front for black market
- **Atmosphere:** Opulent but paranoid—everyone watching everyone
- **Guild Presence:** Coterie operates quietly; merchant guilds control openly

**2. The Undercroft** (South Bank, Lower City)
- **Character:** Poverty, resilience, hidden community
- **Architecture:** Tenements built atop crumbling pre-city ruins, narrow alleys, collapsed sections revealing underground passages
- **Population:** Poor laborers, refugees, thieves, those forgotten by prosperity
- **Key Locations:**
  - **The Broken Compass**: Dockside tavern, Coterie safe house, back room for "meetings"
  - **Fingers' Workshop**: Hidden behind cobbler's shop, cluttered with locks and mechanisms
  - **The Sinking Market**: Black market bazaar in old cistern, accessed via hidden stairways
  - **Ruin Warrens**: Maze of old foundations and cellars, Coterie training ground
- **Atmosphere:** Tight-knit community, everyone knows everyone, outsiders noticed immediately
- **Guild Presence:** Coterie's heart; they protect locals, enforce "street law"

**3. Sovereign's Rise** (North Bank, Hill District)
- **Character:** Old money, political power, ancient bloodlines
- **Architecture:** Marble estates, government buildings, temples with soaring spires
- **Population:** Noble houses, bureaucrats, clergy, their servants
- **Key Locations:**
  - **Temple of the Scales**: Thalos' temple, Sister Vera presides here
  - **Council Hall**: City government, seat of Merchant Council
  - **House Hastings**: Fortified manor of paranoid Lord Eddric
  - **The Remembrance Garden**: Public park where nobles stroll, secret meeting spot
- **Atmosphere:** Formal, ritualized, everyone performing roles
- **Guild Presence:** Minimal; Coterie avoids attention here, operates through noble servants

**4. Harbor District** (Both Banks, River Edge)
- **Character:** Constant motion, diverse cultures, trade and gossip flow freely
- **Architecture:** Warehouses, docks, multi-story taverns, foreign embassies
- **Population:** Sailors, dockhands, foreign merchants, smugglers, fishermen
- **Key Locations:**
  - **The Drowned Mermaid**: Sailor tavern, good for hired muscle or passage upriver
  - **Customs House**: Official inspection point (bribeable)
  - **Foreign Quarter**: Embassy row, exotic goods and cultures
  - **Blackwater Docks**: Smuggler's cove, "unofficial" loading zone
- **Atmosphere:** Boisterous, anonymous, easy to blend in or get lost
- **Guild Presence:** Coterie controls smuggling; dockhands are informants

**5. The Crossroads** (Central, Both Banks)
- **Character:** The city's beating heart, where all classes mingle
- **Architecture:** Mix of old and new, shops and stalls crowding streets, covered bazaars
- **Population:** Artisans, shopkeepers, messengers, everyone passing through
- **Key Locations:**
  - **Grand Market**: Open-air bazaar, hundreds of stalls
  - **Crier's Square**: Public announcements, executions, festivals
  - **The Ledger House**: City archives and records
  - **Seven Bridges Inn**: Common folk inn, good food, gossip central
- **Atmosphere:** Vibrant chaos, opportunity and danger in equal measure
- **Guild Presence:** Coterie recruiter "Sparrow" works market crowds

### The Coterie: Structure & Culture

Not just "thieves guild"—**The Coterie** is a professional organization with century-old traditions.

**Philosophy:**
- "A thief takes. A professional makes the mark forget they had it."
- Never kill without contract (murder draws unwanted attention)
- Never steal from the desperate (bad for business and reputation)
- Honor your debts (or become the city's enemy)

**Hierarchy:**
- **The Silent Council** (3 unknown leaders, identities secret even to most members)
- **Lieutenants** (like Whisper—specialists who run operations)
- **Full Members** (proven thieves, spies, fixers)
- **Marked** (like the Rogue—those who owe favors, not yet members)
- **Shadows** (street informants, not formal members)

**Specializations:**
- **Vaults** (break-ins, safecracking)
- **Faces** (confidence games, impersonation)
- **Whispers** (spies, blackmail)
- **Blades** (enforcers, rare contracts)
- **Fences** (move stolen goods)

**The Shadowmark:**
- Tattoo appears when oath is sworn (magical, tied to individual)
- Invisible except under moonlight
- Burns when debt is called
- Fades when debt is paid
- Becomes **death mark** (visible to all Coterie) if broken

**Shadowmark Powers (While Activated):**
When the mark burns (debt called in), it grants boons to the bearer and their trusted companions—the guild's investment in success:

*For the Marked:*
- **Guild's Edge:** Advantage on checks involving stealth, deception, lockpicking, or underworld knowledge (the Coterie's expertise flows through you)
- **Shadow Strike:** Once per day, double damage on a single attack (shadows guide your blade to vital points)

*For Allies Within 30 Feet:*
- **The Guild's Favor:** Each ally gains one daily use of forced reroll—they can reroll a failed check, or force an enemy to reroll a successful attack/check against them (the Coterie watches over those who serve their interests)

**Coterie Ethics:**
Most members genuinely believe in "honorable thievery." They see themselves as necessary counterbalance to merchant-lord corruption. But recent years have seen drift—some lieutenants taking darker contracts, philosophy compromising.

### L'Argot des Ombres - The Shadow Tongue

The Coterie uses a thieves' cant based on archaic Korshalian dialect mixed with coded phrases. To outsiders, it sounds like mangled Low Common. To initiates, it's precise criminal shorthand.

**Common Phrases:**
- *"La lune sourit"* (The moon smiles) = Job is approved/safe to proceed
- *"Chercher les ombres"* (Seek the shadows) = Lay low, danger nearby
- *"Doigts propres"* (Clean fingers) = No evidence, job went smoothly
- *"Le corbeau chante"* (The raven sings) = Guard/authority approaching
- *"Prix du silence"* (Price of silence) = Bribe required
- *"Marche dans la brume"* (Walk in the fog) = Follow without being seen
- *"Pain sec"* (Dry bread) = Poor target, not worth the risk
- *"Vin doux"* (Sweet wine) = Wealthy target, lucrative job
- *"Couteau et sourire"* (Knife and smile) = Assassin/dangerous contact
- *"La dette vient"* (The debt comes) = Shadowmark activated
- *"Frère/Sœur des toits"* (Brother/Sister of roofs) = Fellow thief greeting
- *"Nuit bénie"* (Blessed night) = Farewell between guild members

**Code Names:** Coterie members use French-inspired monikers (Whisper = *Murmure*, Fingers = *Doigts*, Sparrow = *Moineau*, etc.)

### Daily Life in Korshal

**Economy:**
- River trade dominates (grain, textiles, ore from upstream)
- Merchant-lords control trade guilds
- Common folk work docks, shops, or as servants
- Underground economy thrives (Coterie ensures smooth operation)

**Government:**
- **Merchant Council** (15 members, merchant-lords who "own" city)
- **City Watch** (guard force, corrupt, Coterie bribes many)
- **Noble Houses** (old families with land/titles but less power than merchants)

**Religion:**
- Multiple temples (Thalos most prominent, but also Korthane, Murien, others)
- **Engine Cult** (Azravael) operates secretly among merchants
- Most common folk pray to Ilyra the Hearthbound (home and survival)

**Daily Rhythms:**
- Dawn: Markets open, dockhands load/unload ships
- Midday: Merchant Quarter business peaks, Council meets
- Dusk: Shift change for Watch, opportunity for mischief
- Night: Taverns fill, Undercroft comes alive, Coterie operates
- Bells mark hours (everyone references "three bells past midnight" etc.)

**Current Tensions:**
- Merchant-lords consolidating power (squeezing noble houses)
- Undercroft resentment growing (wealth gap widening)
- Rumors of Engine cult gaining influence
- City Watch increasingly brutal to maintain order

---

## Campaign Hook

**Korshal**—the Crossroads City, where the three great trade roads meet. A sprawling metropolis of 40,000 souls, divided into districts both high and low: the golden-roofed **Merchant Quarter**, the labyrinthine **Undercroft** (the slums built atop old ruins), the stately **Sovereign's Rise** (where nobles dwell), and the bustling **Harbor District** where river meets commerce.

In a city this size, secrets flow like wine. And those who traffic in secrets belong to **The Coterie**—Korshal's oldest thieves guild. Not common cutpurses or murderers, but professional thieves, spies, and information brokers. They operate by strict codes: never kill without contract, never steal from the poor, honor your debts.

**[The Rogue PC]** knows The Coterie well. Years ago, they needed help—a narrow escape, a debt forgiven, a contact made, or training received. In exchange, they bore **The Shadowmark**: a small tattoo behind the left ear, invisible except under moonlight. It marks them as someone who owes the guild **one favor, no questions asked**.

**Last night, the mark burned.**

A message arrived via dead drop: *"The debt comes due. Meet Whisper at the Broken Compass. Three bells past midnight. Come alone, or the mark becomes a warrant."*

The Rogue goes. In the back room of a dockside tavern, they meet **Whisper** (Level 3 Rogue, guild lieutenant)—a hooded figure whose face you never quite remember.

*"You owe us. We're calling it in. Simple job: break into Merchant-Lord Davrik Kaine's vault, steal one item—a **sealed scroll case marked with a red wax phoenix**. Don't open it. Don't read it. Just bring it to us. You have five days before Kaine moves it to a more secure location. Succeed, and your debt is paid. Your mark fades. You're free."*

*"Fail, or betray us, and every thief, fence, smuggler, and shadow in Korshal becomes your enemy. The Coterie does not forgive broken promises."*

**The job seems simple. But nothing in Korshal is ever simple.**

What the Rogue doesn't know yet:
- The scroll contains **evidence of treason** involving multiple noble houses
- Davrik Kaine is a merchant-lord with connections to **Azravael's cult** (the Engine, god of eternal debt)
- The Coterie is being manipulated by a rival faction
- Stealing the scroll will put the party at the center of a conspiracy that threatens the entire city

**The PCs must plan the heist, navigate guild politics, decide who to trust, and ultimately choose: honor the debt, or expose the truth?**

---

## Story Progression

### Session 1: The Debt & First Steps
**Level 1-2 - The Hook & Initial Reconnaissance**

#### Opening Scene: The Burning Mark

The session begins with **[The Rogue PC]** experiencing the Shadowmark activation:

*Last night, as midnight bells rang across Korshal, the mark behind your left ear began to burn. Not painful—but impossible to ignore. A cold fire that whispers: "The debt comes due." You've felt it before—the night you received it—but never like this. This is the call. The Coterie wants payment.*

*A street urchin approached you this morning with a simple message: "Broken Compass. Three bells past midnight. Whisper waits. Come alone, or the mark becomes a warrant."*

The Rogue explains their history with The Coterie to the party (player provides details—encourage creative backgrounds). Establish what the debt was for:
- Escape from city guards after a job gone wrong?
- Training in specialized skills?
- Protection from a dangerous enemy?
- Debt forgiveness from a larger obligation?

**Party Inclusion:** Why do the other PCs help?
- Friendship/loyalty to the Rogue
- Their own reasons to oppose Kaine (he wronged them or their families)
- Coterie offered to pay them (50 silver each upfront)
- Curiosity about the legendary guild
- Simply love a good heist

---

#### Scene 1: The Broken Compass

**Setting:** Dockside tavern in the Undercroft, late night. Salt-smell from river, creaking wood, sailors gambling. The back room is accessed through the wine cellar—password changes weekly (current: *"Le prix de prospérité"* - The price of prosperity).

**Description:**
The back room is windowless, lit by a single oil lamp. A table with two chairs. On the walls: maps of Korshal with certain buildings marked in code. **Whisper** (*Murmure* in the cant) sits in shadow—you never quite see their face clearly, like memory can't hold the details.

As the Rogue enters, Whisper nods: *"Frère des toits."* (Brother of roofs - thieves' greeting)

**Whisper's Briefing:**

*"You know why you're here. La dette vient—the debt comes. The mark burns. I'll make this simple."*

*"Target: Davrik Kaine. Merchant-Lord. Vin doux—sweet wine. He owns half the river trade and has... friends in uncomfortable places."*

*"Objective: Break into his manor. Reach the vault—third floor, east wing. Inside, you'll find a scroll case. Red wax seal, phoenix mark. Take it. Don't open it. Don't read it. Bring it to us. That's the job."*

*"Timeline: Five days. After that, Kaine moves the scroll somewhere we can't reach. Complete this, and your mark fades. Doigts propres—clean fingers. You're free. Fail, and... well. You understand what it means to break faith with the Coterie."*

**PC Questions (Roleplay Opportunities):**

Q: "What's in the scroll?"
A: *"Not your concern. You're a lockpick, not a politician. Just retrieve it."*

Q: "Why us? Why not your own people?"
A: *"We have our reasons. Kaine has... protection. Direct Coterie involvement would cost more than we're willing to spend. You're outside the usual chains of command. Expendable, if it comes to that. No offense."*

Q: "What support do we get?"
A: *"Tools, information, and one distraction if you need it. After that, you're on your own. This is YOUR debt."*

Q: "What if guards catch us?"
A: *"Don't get caught. If you're captured, the Coterie doesn't know you. The Shadowmark means nothing if you're dead or in chains."*

**What Whisper Provides:**

1. **City Map** (parchment with districts marked, Kaine's manor circled)
2. **Thieves' Toolkit** (lockpicks, glass cutter, 50 feet of silk rope, grappling hook, chalk)
3. **Forged Merchant Credentials** (one set, names the party as "representatives of Westermarch Trading Company")
4. **100 Silver** (expense funds—bribes, supplies, information purchases)
5. **Contact Information:**
   - *"Talk to Doigts—'Fingers'—in the Undercroft. He installed Kaine's vault lock. He'll tell you how to beat it. Use the greeting: 'Frère des toits' so he knows you're guild."*
   - *"Moineau—'Sparrow'—works the Crossroads market. She knows the Watch patrol schedules. Say 'La lune sourit' when you approach."*
   - *"If you need muscle, 'Knuckles' at the Drowned Mermaid hires out. We won't pay for it, but he's reliable. Not guild—don't use cant with him."*

**The Weight of the Mark:**

Before leaving, Whisper says:
*"One more thing. Look at your mark."*

If the Rogue checks (mirror, another PC looking): The Shadowmark is now faintly visible even in normal light, like a fresh scar. It pulses with their heartbeat.

*"It'll get stronger the closer you come to breaking your word. Complete the job, and it fades by dawn. Betray us... and every shadow in Korshal will see you for what you are: an oath-breaker. There's no running from that."*

Whisper pauses at the door: *"The mark isn't just a collar—it's a key. While it burns, you carry the guild's favor. Your hands will be steadier, your blade truer. Those who travel with you... the shadows will smile on them too. Use it well."*

Whisper offers a final phrase in cant: *"Marche dans la brume, frère. Nuit bénie."* (Walk in the fog, brother. Blessed night.)

**Mechanical Note:** While the Shadowmark is activated, the Rogue gains advantage on stealth, deception, lockpicking, and underworld knowledge checks, plus one Shadow Strike per day (double damage). Allies within 30 feet gain The Guild's Favor (one reroll per day—force reroll of their own failed checks or enemy successes against them). These powers fade if the debt is paid or the mark becomes a death mark.

**Whisper leaves.** The party is alone with their mission.

---

#### Scene 2: First Steps in the City

**Objective:** Begin gathering information. Give PCs freedom to choose their approach.

**Time Management:** Establish that the party has 5 days (120 hours game time). Each major activity takes time:
- Gathering rumors/investigations: 2-4 hours
- Stakeout/surveillance: 4-6 hours
- Social infiltration: 4-8 hours (including prep)
- Rest: 8 hours per night

Track time loosely but remind players periodically how many days remain.

**Activity 1: Establish a Base**

Where does the party operate from?

**Option A: Rent rooms at Seven Bridges Inn** (Crossroads, 10 silver/night for group)
- Advantage: Central location, anonymous, good for information gathering
- Disadvantage: No privacy, Watch patrols nearby

**Option B: Use Coterie safe house in Undercroft** (free, Whisper offers)
- Advantage: Hidden, Coterie resources nearby, free
- Disadvantage: Monitored by guild (privacy concerns), in poor district

**Option C: Splurge on Golden Scales Inn** (Merchant Quarter, 50 silver/night)
- Advantage: Near target, blend in with wealthy patrons, comfortable
- Disadvantage: Expensive, scrutinized by Kaine's people possibly

Their choice affects which NPCs they interact with and what rumors they overhear.

---

**Activity 2: Learn About Kaine (General Knowledge)**

**Ask around the Crossroads Market** (Basic 2+ Investigation/Social):

Common knowledge gathered from merchants, gossiping shopkeepers:
- Davrik Kaine made his fortune 15 years ago, rose rapidly
- Ruthless businessman, competitors often "choose" to sell to him
- Lives in fortified manor, Merchant Quarter
- Widower (wife died 8 years ago, mysterious circumstances)
- Has one daughter, rarely seen in public
- Known to collect rare documents and contracts

**Rumors (Advanced 3+ Social, costs drinks/bribes, 10-20 silver):**
- *"Kaine doesn't just trade goods—he trades in obligations. People owe him."*
- *"Three merchant rivals died in 'accidents' over the years. Convenient timing."*
- *"He hosts monthly gatherings. Only the wealthy attend. They say deals are made that don't appear in any ledger."*
- *"His guards are paid well—very well. Loyal. Don't bother trying to bribe them."*
- *"I heard the Temple of the Scales investigated him once. Dropped it suddenly. Someone was paid off."*

**Expert (4+ Investigation with specific research direction):**
- Records at The Ledger House show Kaine's business acquisitions correlate with competitors falling into sudden debt
- Pattern suggests supernatural influence—possibly divine contract magic

---

**Activity 3: Scout Kaine's Manor (Exterior)**

**Location:** Merchant Quarter, eastern edge near old city walls

**Description:**
Three-story stone manor, 60 feet tall at peak. Surrounded by 10-foot stone wall with iron spikes. Fortified—windows barred on ground floor, shuttered on upper floors. Small courtyard visible through gate. East wing appears to be the "personal" section (fewer windows, reinforced brick).

**Exterior Observation (2-4 hours, Basic 2+ Perception):**

Obvious details:
- Main gate (iron-bound oak, two guards posted 24/7)
- Servant entrance (rear, single guard during day, locked at night)
- No trees near walls (cleared to prevent climbing approaches)
- Second-floor balconies (three visible, doors locked from inside)
- Rooftop has chimney stacks and what looks like a skylight (east side, third floor)

**Longer Observation (4-6 hours, Advanced 3+ Perception/Investigation):**

Guard patterns:
- **6 guards total:** 2 at main gate, 2 patrolling grounds, 1 at servant entrance, 1 inside (rotating)
- Patrols change every 2 hours
- Shift change at dawn (6 bells) and dusk (18 bells)—brief 10-15 minute gap with reduced alertness
- At night (after 22 bells), 2 mastiff dogs released into courtyard

**Daily routines observed:**
- Kaine leaves manor at midday (12 bells) via carriage, returns 2-3 hours later
- Servants (4-5 visible) enter/exit through rear entrance
- Delivery wagons arrive twice daily: morning (8 bells), afternoon (15 bells)
- Daughter (Elara) appears briefly at second-floor window some evenings, looking out sadly

**Architectural assessment (Expert 4+ Engineering/Architecture or Ranger with urban experience):**
- East wall has slightly looser mortar (easier climbing, Advanced 3+ instead of Expert 4+)
- Chimney stacks are wide enough to climb inside (risky, potential for getting stuck)
- Skylight appears to be hinged (opens for ventilation), third floor
- Adjacent building (3-story warehouse) has rooftop access—possible jump point (15-foot gap, risky)

**NPC Encounter During Surveillance:**

If PCs scout multiple times, they notice **someone else watching the manor**:

A hooded figure (40 yards away, different vantage point) also observing Kaine's estate. If PCs approach:

**Reveal: This is "Glass"** (Level 2 Rogue, independent thief, NOT Coterie)
- Friendly if PCs are non-aggressive
- If PCs use Coterie cant, she bristles: *"Save your fancy French for the guild rats. I'm freelance."*
- *"Scouting Kaine too? Yeah, he's got something I want. No, not the scroll—something else. We're not competing. You do your job, I'll do mine. Maybe we help each other. I know the guard captain's schedule. You interested?"*

**Trade Opportunity:**
- Glass offers information on Captain Harrick (vault guard) in exchange for party causing a distraction during THEIR heist (different day/target)
- OR party can intimidate/persuade Glass to share info (Advanced 3+ Social)
- OR party can ignore Glass entirely

**Information Glass Provides (if deal made):**
- Captain Harrick guards the third floor personally at night
- Harrick is loyal but expensive—bribery would cost 200+ silver minimum
- Vault door is trapped (doesn't know details, but saw Fingers install it years ago)
- Kaine has "something else" protecting his valuables (Glass thinks it's magical)

This encounter adds a wildcard—another thief in play, potential ally or future complication.

---

**Session 1 Ends With:**

Summary of what PCs learned during their first day/night in Korshal:
- Basic layout of Kaine's manor exterior
- General knowledge about Kaine's reputation
- Awareness that others are also interested in Kaine
- 4 days remaining until deadline
- List of contacts to pursue (Fingers, Sparrow, possibly Glass)

**Optional Cliffhanger:**

As party returns to their lodgings that night, they notice:
- Someone has been in their room (subtle signs: items slightly moved, window ajar)
- Nothing stolen, but a message left in charcoal on the table: *"Chercher les ombres. You're not the only ones the Coterie hired. Stay out of each other's way. Nuit bénie. -S"*
  - (Translation: "Seek the shadows" - lay low, avoid conflict)

**Mystery:** Is "S" another team?A rival thief? Or is Whisper testing them? The use of proper cant suggests they're guild.

---

### Session 2: Deep Investigation & Preparation
**Level 2 - Building the Plan**

#### Opening: Three Days Remain

Session begins with PCs having completed initial reconnaissance. They've seen the manor, know the basics. Now it's time to dig deeper.

**Morning in Korshal:**

Describe the city waking up based on where PCs are staying:
- **Seven Bridges Inn**: Breakfast crowd of artisans heading to workshops, criers announcing news in the square
- **Undercroft safe house**: Children playing in alleys, smell of cook-fires, someone being "escorted" by Coterie enforcers
- **Golden Scales**: Perfumed merchants discussing trade over expensive wine, servants polishing silver

**News of the Day (from criers or gossip):**
- *"Merchant Council meets today to discuss new tariffs!"*
- *"Three more dock workers disappeared last week—authorities baffled!"*
- *"Lord Hastings' estate doubles guard—paranoia or prudence?"*

These rumors seed future plot points (nobles already nervous, Kaine's influence growing).

---

#### Scene 1: Investigation Options

The PCs have multiple avenues to explore. Encourage them to split up or tackle these sequentially. Each option provides different pieces of the puzzle.

---

##### Option 1: Talk to Fingers (Vault Intel)

**Location:** Undercroft, a cluttered workshop hidden behind a cobbler's shop. A chalk mark on the door (three lines crossed) signals a guild safe house.

**Fingers** (*Doigts* - elderly human, Level 2 Scholar, former master thief, now retired):

When the party uses the greeting *"Frère/Sœur des toits,"* Fingers' suspicious glare softens:
- *"Ah, Murmure sent you. About damn time."* He switches to cant briefly: *"Vin doux, non? Kaine?"* (Sweet wine, yes? Kaine?)

*"Coterie sending kids after Kaine now? Hah. Desperate times. Sit. Don't touch anything. That trap's live."*

**Information Gained (Basic 2+ Influence or bribe of 50 silver):**
- *"Davrik Kaine? Paranoid bastard. Had me install his vault lock twelve years ago. Then tried to have me killed so I couldn't tell anyone how it works. Joke's on him—I'm still here, and I remember everything."*
- Vault door has a **three-tumbler mechanical lock** (requires Expert 4+ lockpicking OR the combination)
- Lock is trapped: failed attempts trigger a poison needle (1 HD damage + Constitution check or paralyzed 10 minutes)
- Combination changes monthly, but Fingers knows the pattern: *"Kaine uses dates. His daughter's birthday, his wife's death anniversary, his first profit margin. Sentimental fool."*

**Advanced (3+) Investigation/Social:**
- Fingers reveals Kaine also has a **magical ward** on the vault: *"Some kind of alert spell. If the door opens without the proper command word, bells ring in the guards' barracks. Silent alarm."*
- *"You'll need a mage to dispel it, or... find out the command word. Kaine keeps notes. He's too paranoid NOT to write things down."*

**Expert (4+) Persuasion (Fingers likes the Rogue if they show respect):**
- Fingers gives them his old **master lockpick set** (+1d6 to lockpicking checks, one-time gift). He mutters in cant as he hands it over: *"Doigts propres, oui? Promise me."* (Clean fingers, yes? Leave no trace.)
- Warns: *"Be careful. I've heard rumors. Kaine's hosting someone important in three days—a 'business partner' from out of town. Extra security. Whatever you're planning, do it before then or after they leave."*
- As they leave: *"Nuit bénie, mes amis."* (Blessed night, my friends.)

---

##### Option 1B: Meet Sparrow (Watch Patrol Intelligence)

**Location:** Crossroads Market, midday. Crowds, merchants hawking wares, colorful chaos.

**Finding Sparrow:** She works as a flower vendor, but the Rogue knows the signs—chalk marks on her stall (Coterie symbols), specific flower arrangements that signal "safe to approach."

**Greeting:** When the party approaches and the Rogue says *"La lune sourit,"* Sparrow's eyes flicker with recognition.

**Sparrow** (young woman, Level 2 Rogue, guild recruiter and spy):
- Friendly, casual, speaks in code even in public
- *"Ah, seeking moonlight, are we? Vin doux or pain sec?"* (Sweet wine or dry bread? - profitable target or waste of time?)
- When confirmed it's Kaine: *"Vin doux indeed. But le corbeau chante often in that quarter."* (The raven sings - guards patrol heavily)

**Information Gained (she shares freely with guild-marked):**
- *"City Watch patrols Merchant Quarter every two hours at night. Three bells, five bells, seven bells past dusk. Captain Harrick pays them to ignore Kaine's manor—they walk past, don't actually check. Lazy."*
- *"But Kaine has his own guards. Six. Shift change at dawn and dusk—marche dans la brume during those ten minutes."* (Walk in the fog - best infiltration window)
- *"Dogs loose after midnight. Two mastiffs. Mean ones. Heard they killed a beggar last month who climbed the wall."*

**Bonus Information (Basic 2+ Social):**
- Sparrow reveals she's been watching Kaine too: *"Not for a job. Recruitment. He's hiring muscle. That means something big is coming. Whisper wants to know what."*
- If PCs share information about the scroll later, she'll remember the favor

**As they leave:** *"Bonne chance, Doigts propres."* (Good luck, Clean fingers.)

---

##### Option 2: Scout Kaine's Manor

**Location:** Merchant Quarter, a three-story stone manor surrounded by 10-foot walls

**Exterior Observation (Basic 2+ Perception/Investigation):**
- Main gate (guarded, two guards at all times)
- Servant entrance (back, less guarded but locked)
- Second-floor balconies (accessible via climbing, Advanced 3+ Athletics)
- Rooftop access via adjacent building (risky, requires Acrobatics)

**Advanced (3+) Stealth/Observation (requires spending 2-3 hours watching):**
- Guard patrol pattern (changes every 2 hours, 6 guards total, 2 inside, 4 patrolling grounds)
- Dogs released at night (2 mastiffs, patrol courtyard)
- Shift change at dawn and dusk (brief 10-minute window with reduced vigilance)
- Delivery wagons arrive at servant entrance twice daily (potential infiltration vector)

**Expert (4+) Investigation/Architecture:**
- Notice rooftop skylight (leads to third floor, possibly vault area)
- Identify weak point in east wall (loose bricks, easier climb)
- Observe Kaine's routine: leaves manor daily at noon for two hours (Koine's Mercantile, his office)

**Risky Option: Break In During Scouting:**
- If PCs attempt infiltration without planning, guards detect them (Chase encounter or Stealth contest)
- Failure = guards alert, future infiltration harder (extra patrol, +1d6 difficulty to all stealth checks)

---

##### Option 3: Social Approach - Infiltrate as Guests

**Method:** Use forged credentials to attend one of Kaine's "business gatherings" (he hosts monthly meetings with merchants)

**Requirements:**
- Forged documents (provided by Whisper)
- Appropriate attire (costs 20 silver for party, or Advanced 3+ Deception to bluff with commoner clothes)
- Convincing backstory (party must agree on cover identity)

**The Gathering (Social Encounter):**

Kaine hosts 15-20 merchants in his main hall (ground floor). Wine flows. Deals are made. It's a networking event.

**Objective:** Mingle, gain trust, gather information about vault location and security

**Social Challenges:**

**Challenge 1: Entry Scrutiny (Basic 2+ Deception/Influence)**
- Doorman checks credentials
- Failure = recognized as frauds, escorted out (backup plan needed)

**Challenge 2: Blend In (Advanced 3+ Social/Performance)**
- Partygoers are merchants—talk trade, economics, rumors
- Success = gain trust, invited to "inner circle" conversation
- Failure = seem suspicious, watched closely by guards

**Challenge 3: Extract Information (Advanced 3+ Influence/Investigation)**
- Casually ask about Kaine's security, vault location, recent acquisitions
- Success = learn vault is on third floor, east wing; guard captain is "Harrick" (bribeable? maybe)
- Critical Success (Expert 4+) = overhear conversation: *"Davrik, when is your guest from the Concordium arriving? Three days? Will the scroll be ready for transfer?"*

**Opportunity:**
- If Rogue/party succeeds at ALL challenges, they may slip away to explore manor during gathering
- Can scout first and second floors (not vault level—too guarded)
- Find Kaine's study on second floor (possible location of combination notes)

---

##### Option 4: Bribe/Interrogate Guards

**Method:** Locate off-duty guards, attempt to bribe or intimidate for information

**Locations:** Taverns near Merchant Quarter

**Target: Guard-Corporal Jenna Darrow** (Level 1 Combatant, dissatisfied with pay)

**Approach:**

**Bribery (Advanced 3+, costs 100+ silver):**
- Jenna reveals guard schedule, number of guards, dog patrol times
- Warns: *"Vault's on third floor. Only Kaine and Captain Harrick have keys. Door's warded—magic stuff. And... there's something else up there. I've heard noises at night. Movement. Kaine might have a guardian."*

**Intimidation (Expert 4+, risks alerting Kaine):**
- Same info as bribery, but Jenna reports attempt to Captain Harrick
- Future infiltration has +1d6 difficulty (guards on alert)

**Persuasion/Sympathy (Advanced 3+, if party appeals to Jenna's sense of justice):**
- Learn Jenna hates working for Kaine: *"He treats us like thugs. Pays late. Three guards 'disappeared' last year when they asked too many questions. If you're going after him... good. Just don't get caught. I don't want to have to fight you."*
- She might "accidentally" leave a door unlocked during next session

---

##### Option 5: Research Kaine's Background

**Method:** Visit city archives, libraries, or underworld contacts

**Location:** The Ledger House (city records) or Undercroft information brokers

**Scholar/Investigation check (Advanced 3+, takes 1 day of research):**

**What They Learn:**
- Davrik Kaine arrived in Korshal 15 years ago with modest wealth
- Rapid rise to power—made fortune through "fortunate" trade deals
- Rumored connection to **the Engine's cult** (Azravael, goddess of eternal debt)
- Three of his major business rivals died in "accidents" over the years
- His wife died 8 years ago under mysterious circumstances (no body found)
- He has one daughter, **Elara Kaine** (age 16), kept isolated in the manor

**Expert (4+ Scholar/History check):**
- Kaine's fortune correlates with other merchants falling into debt
- Pattern suggests supernatural influence: victims make deals, prosper briefly, then lose everything
- The scroll he possesses may be leverage—evidence of debts or pacts he's forcing nobles into

**Clue:** Kaine isn't just a merchant. He's an **oath-broker**—he traps people in contracts enforced by Azravael's power.

---

#### Scene 2: Planning the Heist

After gathering information (PCs choose which leads to pursue), they must plan their approach.

**Heist Options:**

1. **Stealth Infiltration** (classic break-in, requires good Stealth/lockpicking)
2. **Social Deception** (pose as servants/merchants, Bluff through)
3. **Distraction** (Coterie creates diversion, party sneaks in during chaos)
4. **Rooftop Entry** (climb, skylight access, athletic but avoids ground patrols)
5. **Inside Help** (bribe Jenna to leave door unlocked, reduce difficulty)

**The Party Decides:**
- Entry point
- Timing (night, during gathering, during Kaine's absence)
- Roles (who infiltrates, who keeps watch, who handles locks/magic)
- Contingencies (if caught, escape routes)

**GM Prep:** Based on their plan, determine difficulty of upcoming session. Clever plans reduce DCs; reckless plans increase risks.

---

**Session 2 Ends With:**
- Heist plan finalized
- Information gathered (some or all of above)
- Party understands: 5 days timeline, high-stakes job, Coterie expects success
- Optional cliffhanger: Whisper sends message: *"Heard you've been asking questions. Good. But be careful. Others are watching Kaine too. You're not the only thieves in this city."*

---

### Session 3: The Heist - Infiltration
**Level 2 - Into the Lion's Den**

#### Opening: The Night of the Heist

Session begins with PCs executing their plan. Time: Evening, as chosen (either gathering night or standard night infiltration).

**Set the Atmosphere:**

*Korshal at night: Bells ring the hour. River mist creeps through streets. Lantern-light flickers in windows. In the Merchant Quarter, everything is quieter—private guards patrol with purpose, not the lazy Watch of other districts.*

*Kaine's manor looms ahead. Three stories of stone and secrets. This is it. No turning back now.*

**PC Preparations:**

- Final equipment check
- Establish roles one more time
- Set rendezvous points if separated
- Last chance for pep talk or prayer

---

#### Act 1: Gaining Entry (Varies by Plan)

Each entry method has unique challenges:

##### A) Rooftop Approach (Athletic/Stealth)

**Step 1: Reach Adjacent Building**
- Warehouse next door, three stories
- Requires Basic (2+) Athletics to climb exterior (maintenance ladder) or
- Break in via ground-floor door (Advanced 3+ lockpicking)

**Step 2: Cross to Kaine's Roof**
- 15-foot gap between buildings
- Options:
  - **Jump** (Advanced 3+ Athletics, failure = fall 30 feet, 4 HD damage, loud crash)
  - **Rope bridge** (if brought grappling hook, requires 2 successful throws)
- Wind at night adds difficulty

**Step 3: Access Skylight**
- Hinged glass skylight on east side roof
- Basic (2+ lockpicking OR simple glass cutter usage)
- Failure with glass cutter = loud crack (Alarm +1)
- Success = enter third-floor hallway directly (bypasses most manor)

**Advantage:** Closest to vault
**Disadvantage:** Risky; loud entry

##### B) Servant Entrance (Stealth/Social)

**Step 1: Approach Rear Gate**
- Single guard posted (if Jenna didn't unlock)
- Options:
  - **Distraction** (if hired Sparrow, fire starts elsewhere, guard leaves post)
  - **Stealth takedown** (Advanced 3+ combat, must be non-lethal and silent)
  - **Disguise** (if bought servant clothes from Sparrow, Basic 2+ Deception)
  - **Unlocked door** (if Jenna helped, automatic entry)

**Step 2: Interior Navigation**
- Ground floor: kitchens, servant quarters, guard room
- Must reach stairs to second floor without detection
- **Stealth Challenge:** Guard room door is open (2 guards inside playing cards)
  - Stealth contest: PCs vs. Guard Perception (Base difficulty 2+)
  - Can lure guards away with noise, wait for patrol to move, or sneak past

**Advantage:** Quieter entry, familiar servant routes
**Disadvantage:** Must navigate two full floors to reach vault

##### C) Social Infiltration (During Gathering)

**Step 1: Enter as Guests**
- Forged credentials checked at door
- Basic (2+ Deception if credentials good, Advanced 3+ if suspicious)
- Failure = turned away or detained

**Step 2: Blend and Separate**
- Main hall on ground floor, crowded with merchants
- Party must split: some maintain cover (stay visible), others slip away
- **Social Challenge:** Keep Kaine/Marra distracted while others infiltrate
  - Requires ongoing Deception/Performance checks
  - If infiltrators take too long, hosts notice missing "guests"

**Step 3: Infiltrate During Party**
- Servants moving about (easier to blend if disguised)
- More people = more chances to be seen
- Guards still present, but slightly distracted by event

**Advantage:** Built-in cover story, distraction
**Disadvantage:** Time-limited (gathering lasts 3 hours), more witnesses

---

#### Act 2: Navigating the Manor

**Layout Recap:**

- **Ground Floor:** Main hall, kitchens, dining room, guard room, servant quarters
- **Second Floor:** Kaine's chambers, study, guest rooms, Elara's room, library
- **Third Floor:** Vault (east wing), storage, locked mysterious rooms

**Encounters While Climbing:**

**Encounter 1: Patrol Guards (2 guards, ground to second floor stairs)**

- **Stealth Bypass** (Advanced 3+ Stealth contest)
  - Success= pass unnoticed
  - Failure = guards hear something, investigate (can hide, requires second check)
- **Combat Option** (if detected)
  - 2 guards, 6 HD each, Proficiency 1
  - **If combat lasts 2+ rounds:** Other guards hear (Alarm +1)
  - **Non-lethal takedowns possible** (specify intent, same mechanics)

**Encounter 2: Elara's Room (Optional, second floor)**

If PCs pass by her door, they might hear quiet sobbing.

**Decision Point:** Investigate or ignore?

**If Investigated:**

Door is unlocked (Kaine keeps her prisoner through other means—magical binding or threat).

Inside: Small, sparse room. Teenage girl (Elara) sits by window, crying softly.

She sees PCs, freezes:
*"Please... don't hurt me. Are you Father's people? Or... are you thieves?"*

**Social Encounter (Advanced 3+ Influence/Compassion):**

If PCs are gentle and honest:
- *"You're here for something in the vault. I know. Father keeps terrible things there. Contracts. Papers that bind people's souls."*
- *"I want to help. I hate him. He killed Mother—I know he did, even if no one believes me. And he keeps me here, says I'm 'collateral' for his deals."*

**Critical Information IF PCs earn her trust:**
- **Vault command word:** *"Prosperity's price"* (bypasses magical ward completely)
- **Warning:** *"There's something alive in there. A guardian made of contracts. Father created it. Fire hurts it."*
- **Combination hint:** *"My birthday is the first number: 17. Mother's death anniversary is second: 23rd day. Father's profit margin—he brags about it—is 23%. So: 17-23-23."*

**Cost:** Elara asks: *"When you're done ... Please come back. Get me out. I'll die if I stay here."*

PCs can promise (adding moral weight) or refuse (lose information).

---

#### Act 3: The Third Floor

**Reaching Vault Level:**

Stairs to third floor are narrow, dimly lit. At top: Long hallway (60 feet), vault door at end.

**Final Guardian: Captain Harrick**

Stationed outside vault door. Level 2 Elite Combatant, loyal (or bribed, if PCs arranged it).

**Approach Options:**

**Option A: Captain Was Bribed** (if arranged in Session 2)
- Harrick nods silently, steps aside
- *"Ten minutes. After that, I didn't see you."*
- Automatic bypass

**Option B: Stealth (Expert 4+, extremely difficult)**
- Harrick is alert, positioned to see whole hallway
- Requires invisibility, exceptional skill, or distraction pulling him away
- Success = slip past while he's briefly distracted

**Option C: Combat**

**Captain Harrick:**
- **HD Pool:** 12d6
- **Proficiency:** 2
- **Attack - Longsword** (Advanced 3+): 3 successes, 3 HD damage
- **Shield Bash** (Basic 2+): 2 successes, 1 HD damage + knock prone
- **Defensive Stance** (Reaction): +1d6 to defense when fighting defensively
- **Alarm Raising:** If combat lasts 3+ rounds, Harrick shouts for reinforcements (4 guards arrive in 2 rounds)

**Tactics:**
- Fights defensively near vault door (blocks access)
- Uses Shield Bash to control space
- Yells for help if losing

**Non-Lethal Option:**
- Harrick can be knocked unconscious (specify intent)
- Coterie prefers this (killing raises heat)

**Option D: Deception (if PCs crafted false orders or emergency)**
- Requires Advanced (3+) Deception and prop (forged message)
- *"Captain! Kaine needs you downstairs immediately—intruders at main entrance!"*
- Success = Harrick leaves for 5-10 minutes
- Failure = Harrick suspicious, combat begins

---

**Session 3 Ends With:**

Cliffhanger: PCs stand before the vault door. Harrick dealt with (however they chose). The vault beckons.

*The door is reinforced steel, inscribed with glowing sigils. A three-tumbler lock gleams in lamplight. This is it—everything you've prepared for comes down to the next few minutes.*

**Next session begins with vault breach.**

---

### Session 4: The Vault's Secret
**Level 2-3 - Truth and Consequences**

#### Opening: Breaching the Vault

Recap: PCs have reached the vault. Harrick is bypassed (unconscious, bribed, or absent). Now they must open it.

**The Vault Door:**

Reinforced steel, 4 inches thick. No hinges visible (internal mechanism). Three components:

1. **Mechanical Lock** (three tumblers, titanium)
2. **Magical Ward** (glowing sigils, Engine symbol—broken chain in gear)
3. **Unknown Interior Threat** (if Elara warned them)

---

#### Challenge 1: The Lock

**Lockpicking Attempt:**

- Base Difficulty: Expert (4+)
- **Modifiers:**
  - Master Lockpick Set (from Fingers): +1d6
  - Combination known (17-23-23): Automatic success, no roll needed
  - Attempting without tools: Impossible

**Trap Mechanic:**
- Each failed attempt triggers poison needle
- **Effect:** Basic (2+) Constitution check or Paralyzed for 10 minutes + 1 HD damage
- Needle resets after firing (can trigger multiple times)

**Time Pressure:**
- Each attempt (success or fail) takes 2 minutes
- If guards are alerted elsewhere (earlier alarm), they're en route

**Success:** Lock clicks open. Tumblers slide. Door remains sealed (ward active).

---

#### Challenge 2: The Magical Ward

**Observing the Ward (Advanced 3+ Magic/Religion check):**

Sigils glow faintly blue. Engine symbology (broken chain inside gear—freedom through debt)This is an **alert spell**. Opening door without command word triggers silent alarm to guard barracks.

**Bypassing Options:**

**Option A: Command Word (if learned from Elara)**
- Speak: *"Prosperity's price"*
- Ward flickers, dies
- Automatic success

**Option B: Dispel Magic (Advanced 3+ Magic/Priest ritual)**
- Requires Weaver, Mage, or Priest
- Takes 1 minute, requires concentration
- Success = ward dispelled cleanly
- Failure = ward remains, OR (critical failure) triggers alarm immediately

**Option C: Brute Force / Ignore**
- Open door despite ward
- **Consequence:** Silent alarm triggers
- 4 guards + Harrick (if still alive/conscious) arrive in 3 rounds
- PCs have 3 rounds inside vault before combat

---

#### Inside the Vault

**Description:**

20x20-foot stone chamber. No windows. Shelves line walls:
- Ledgers (hundreds, labeled by year/name)
- Coin chests (gold, silver—thousands of markers)
- Jewelry boxes (valuables)
- Scroll tubes (various, sealed)
- At center pedestal: **THE TARGET—red wax phoenix seal, ornate scroll case**

**But also present:**

**The Guardian** (if PCs didn't learn about it, this is surprise round)

**Animated Contract Effigy**

A humanoid construct made of: parchment skin, inky veins, wax joints. Stands 6 feet tall. Shambles forward when PCs enter (unless they spoke Kaine's name—see below).

**Stats:**
- **HD Pool:** 15d6
- **Proficiency:** 2
- **Appearance:** Body covered in contract text, eyes are wax seals, fingers are quill pens
- **Attacks:**
  - **Binding Tendrils** (Advanced 3+): 3 successes, 2 HD damage + target Restrained (Athletics check to escape)
  - **Debt Mark** (Expert 4+, once per target): Target makes Resolve check or gains "debt curse" (disadvantage on all checks until long rest—psychological weight)
  - **Contract Whip** (Basic 2+): 2 successes, 2 HD slashing
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Fire:** Double damage
  - **Radiant/Holy magic:** +1d6 damage
  - **Ripping contracts:** If PCs specifically target its "body" (Advanced 3+ called shot), tear parchment for extra damage
- **Resistances:**
  - Physical weapons (half damage unless magical)

**Tactics:**
- Prioritizes Restraining intruders (hold for guards)
- Uses Debt Mark sparingly (draining)
- Relentless—fights until destroyed

**Bypassing Guardian (if PCs researched Engine rituals, Expert 4+ Religion to deduce):**
- Speaking Kaine's full name aloud while touching scroll: *"Davrik Casimir Kaine"*
- Guardian registers speaker as "authorized," ignores them
- Very few PCs will know this unless they did deep research

---

#### The Scroll Case

Once Guardian is defeated/bypassed and lock/ward are handled:

**The Target:** Ornate wooden case, 18 inches long, red wax seal (phoenix), locked clasp.

**Locked Clasp:** Basic (2+) lockpicking or break it (1 HD to case, fragile)

**Temptation:**

Whisper's orders were clear: **Do NOT open it. Do NOT read it.**

But... the Rogue's Shadowmark pulses hot. Curiosity burns. What's inside?

**Player Choice:** Open or deliver sealed?

---

**If Opened (requires conscious decision to disobey):**

Inside: Single parchment scroll, folded. Text is mix of legal language and infernal script (glows faintly red).

**Reading it (Advanced 3+ Scholar to understand legal terms, Basic 2+ Religion to recognize infernal):**

**The Contract's Contents:**

> *CONTRACT OF PERPETUAL OBLIGATION BETWEEN:*
> - **Party of the First Part:** Davrik Casimir Kaine, Merchant-Lord of Korshal
> - **Parties of the Second Part:** Lord Eddric Hastings, Lady Serana Corven, Baron Kellan Threllis
>
> *WHEREAS the Parties of the Second Part did willingly embezzle *50,000 gold markers* from the City Defense Fund for personal enrichment;*
>
> *AND WHEREAS said Parties sought aid from Party of the First Part to conceal said embezzlement;*
>
> *NOW THEREFORE:*
> - Party of the First Part agrees to loan 50,000 gold markers to Parties of the Second Part
> - Interest compounds at 15% per month, perpetually
> - Collateral: The immortal souls of Parties of the Second Part
> - Enforcement: Azravael, Goddess of the Engine, Keeper of Debts
>
> *TERMS:*
> - Debt cannot be repaid (sum increases faster than payment possible)
> - Upon death, souls forfeit to the Engine's custody
> - Should this contract be removed from Party of First Part's possession without proper release ritual, Parties of Second Part expire immediately and souls are claimed
>
> *Sealed under the Engine's Gaze, 9th Year of Current Count*

**Translation:** This isn't just evidence of embezzlement—it's a **soul-binding contract**. Three nobles are trapped in eternal debt. If the scroll leaves Kaine's hands improperly, they DIE and their souls go to Azravael.

**Realization:** The Coterie plans to deliver this scroll to someone (rival nobles? Engine cult? the nobles themselves for ransom?). Delivering it as ordered might kill three people.

---

#### Escape & Decision

Alarm level determines escape difficulty:

**Alarm 0 (Perfect Execution):**
- Exit same way they came
- No encounters
- Reach safe house easily

**Alarm 1-2 (Partial Detection):**
- Guards searching manor
- 2-3 Stealth checks (Advanced 3+) or combat encounters while escaping
- Chase into streets if spotted

**Alarm 3+ (Full Lockdown):**
- Manor sealed
- Combat: 6 guards + dogs blocking exits
- Must break through window, fight way out, or surrender
- If surrender: Captured, taken to Kaine (interrogation scene, Coterie disavows them)

---

**Assuming Successful Escape:**

PCs return to safe house or inn with the scroll. Dawn approaches.

**Rogue's Shadowmark:** If scroll is sealed and unread, mark cools slightly (debt nearly paid). If opened, mark burns hotter (disobeyed orders).

**The Choice:**

Do they:
1. **Deliver to Whisper immediately** (honor debt, don't ask questions)
2. **Open scroll and read it** (if haven't already)
3. **Investigate further** (who are the nobles? what's their crime? can contract be broken?)

**Most parties choose option 3** (especially if they read scroll and understand implications).

---

**Session 4 Ends With:**

PCs have scroll. They know (or suspect) its dark purpose. Moral dilemma crystallizes:

- Honor the Shadowmark debt = deliver scroll = three nobles die, souls claimed
- Break the debt = face Coterie's wrath
- Find third option = break the contract itself, free the nobles, expose everyone

**Whisper sends message:** *"You have the scroll. Good. Meet me at the Broken Compass. Tonight. Don't be late. Don't disappoint me."*

**The Rogue's Shadowmark is burning. They're running out of time.**

---

### Session 5: Breaking the Chains
**Level 3 - Final Choice & Resolution**

#### Opening: The Confrontation

Morning after the heist. City criers announce:

*"Daring robbery at Merchant-Lord Kaine's estate! Valuable documents stolen! Reward offered for information! Kaine demands justice!"*

Kaine has mobilized. Watch is investigating. But PCs are safe (for now—unless they left obvious evidence).

**Whisper's Summons:**

Message delivered: *"Tonight. Broken Compass. Bring the scroll. Your debt ends tonight—one way or another."*

---

#### Scene 1: The Moral Crossroads

Party must decide before meeting Whisper.

**Option A: Deliver the Scroll (Honor the Debt)**

Pros:
- Shadowmark debt paid, Rogue free
- Coterie remains ally
- Simplest path

Cons:
- Three nobles DIE (souls to Azravael)
- Moral guilt
- Embezzlement goes unpunished (nobles dead, money vanishes)

**If Chosen:** Skip to Scene 4 (Whisper takes scroll, mark fades, nobles die in their sleep that night—news next day)

---

**Option B: Refuse Delivery / Break the Debt**

Pros:
- Moral high ground
- Potential to save nobles
- Expose corruption

Cons:
- Shadowmark becomes death mark
- Coterie becomes enemy
- Must find way to break soul contract

**If Chosen:** Continue to Scene 2

---

**Option C: Leverage Against Everyone (Sovereign power play)**

Approach nobles directly:
*"We have your contract. Pay us handsomely + confess embezzlement + return stolen gold to city, or we deliver it and you die."*

Pros:
- Party profits
- Justice partially served
- Coterie gets scroll (empty case with fake?) or party negotiates

Cons:
- Dangerous (nobles might hire assassins)
- Morally gray
- Complex execution

**If Chosen:** Requires Expert (4+) Sovereign checks to execute, leads to Scene 3 alternate path

---

**Most Parties Choose Option B (Adventure Path):**

#### Scene 2: Finding a Way to Break the Contract

**Research (Advanced 3+ Scholar/Religion):**

Soul-binding contracts enforced by Azravael are nearly unbreakable. BUT:

- **Thalos of the Even Hand** (god of balance, consequence, choice) opposes tyrannical debt
- Rituals exist to sever contracts if parties consent AND proper component is provided
- Requires priest of Thalos or Aubret

**Where to Find Help:**

**Temple of the Scales** (Sovereign's Rise)

Meet: **Sister Vera** (Level 3 Priest of Thalos)

**Social Encounter (Advanced 3+ Influence, explaining situation):**

Sister Vera listens carefully:
*"This is Azravael's work. The Engine binds through fear and greed. These nobles are guilty of embezzlement, yes—but eternal soul-slavery? That is tyranny, not justice."*

*"Thalos teaches: all debts must have endings. I can perform the Ritual of Unbinding. But it requires components."*

**Ritual Requirements:**

1. **The Contract itself** (PCs have it)
2. **Consent from all three signatory nobles** (must convince them)
3. **Three drops of blood from each noble** (voluntary donation)
4. **Kaine's Contract Signet Ring** (proves he's original debt-holder, allows severance)
5. **Full moon** (next one is TONIGHT—timing works perfectly)

**The Catch:**

- Must gather noble blood TODAY (time pressure)
- Must steal Kaine's ring (return to manor, much more dangerous now)
- Ritual takes 1 hour, must defend Sister Vera while she performs it

---

#### Scene 3: Gathering the Components

**Task 1: Convince the Three Nobles**

Each noble presents unique challenge:

##### Noble 1: Lord Eddric Hastings (Paranoid)

**Location:** Fortified manor, Sovereign's Rise

**Difficulty:** Advanced (3+) Social

**Approach:**
Hastings is terrified (rightly suspects Kaine sent assassins).

*"Who sent you? Kaine? The Coterie? I'll have you arrested!"*

Must prove they're trying to help:
- Show the contract (evidence they have it)
- Explain ritual can free him
- Appeal to his fear: *"Kaine owns your soul. When you die, you don't go to ancestors—you go to the Engine. Forever."*

**Success:** Hastings agrees, provides blood drop willingly
**Failure:** Hastings calls guards, PCs must flee or fight

##### Noble 2: Lady Serana Corven (Nihilistic)

**Location:** Luxury estate, Sovereign's Rise

**Difficulty:** Expert (4+) Social

**Approach:**
Corven knows about soul debt, doesn't care:

*"So I embezzled. So my soul's forfeit. I've lived well. What's another 30 years before damnation? Why should I care?"*

Must break through her nihilism:
- Describe Engine's torment (eternal servitude, no rest, no release)
- Offer vision of redemption (break free, repent, restore good name)
- **Or** threaten: *"Help us or we deliver contract immediately. You die tonight."*

**Success:** Corven sighs, agrees, provides blood
**Failure:** She laughs, calls security

##### Noble 3: Baron Kellan Threllis (Guilt-Ridden)

**Location:** Modest townhouse, Crossroads (he's not wealthy anymore—spent everything)

**Difficulty:** Basic (2+) Social

**Approach:**
Threllis is broken by guilt:

*"I'm a coward. I stole from the city. From people who needed protection. And then I sold my soul to cover it up. I deserve damnation."*

Easiest to convince:
*"You can make this right. Help us free everyone. Return the money.Confess. Face justice in THIS life, not the Engine."*

**Success:** Threllis weeps, agrees immediately, provides blood
**Failure:** (Hard to fail—he wants help)

---

**Task 2: Steal Kaine's Signet Ring**

**The Problem:** Must return to Kaine's manor. He's now on high alert. Security doubled.

**Options:**

**A) Ambush Kaine Outside the Manor**
- Wait for his daily trip to Koine's Mercantile (midday)
- Intercept carriage en route
- **Combat Encounter:** Kaine + 2 bodyguards in public street
- Risk: City Watch might intervene (adds complexity)

**B) Infiltrate Manor Again (Nightmare Mode)**
- All alarms from previous heist still active
- Extra guards (+4), dogs always loose
- Kaine is present, paranoid
- **Stealth DCs increase by +1d6 across the board**
- Target: His personal chambers, he wears ring always

**C) Social Deception**
- Pose as Engine cult members (requires cult knowledge)
- Claim "Concordium sent us to retrieve the contract"
- Gain audience with Kaine, attempt sleight of hand or betrayal
- Extremely risky (Expert 4+ Deception), but avoids combat

**Most Direct Path: Option A (Ambush)**

---

**Combat Encounter: Kaine's Carriage**

**Davrik Kaine** (Level 3 Sovereign, Engine Cultist)
- **HD Pool:** 18d6
- **Proficiency:** 3
- **Attacks:**
  - **Soul Lash** (Advanced 3+): 3 successes, 2 HD necrotic + target loses 1 Resolve (manifests as spectral chain)
  - **Binding Oath** (Expert 4+, once per encounter): Target makes Resolve check or becomes Compelled (must obey one command, lasts 1 minute)
  - **Debt Shield** (Reaction): When attacked, call on bound soul—one nearby NPC (driver, bystander) takes damage instead (cruel)
- **Equipment:** Signet ring (target), ornate dagger, leather coat with hidden armor

**2 Engine Enforcers** (Level 2 Combatants)
- **HD Pool:** 10d6 each
- **Proficiency:** 2
- **Attack - Mace** (Advanced 3+): 3 successes, 3 HD damage
- **Tactics:** Guard Kaine, aggressive fighting

**Combat Location:** Street ambush (civilians present, Watch might arrive if combat exceeds 5 rounds)

**Objectives:**
- Defeat or disable Kaine
- **Steal ring** (worn on his finger—requires knock him out or kill, or Expert 4+ sleight of hand during combat)
- Escape before Watch arrives

**If Kaine is Defeated:**

Ring obtained. He's unconscious or dead (party's choice). If alive, he knows who stole from him now.

**Consequence:** Kaine (if alive) will retaliate later. If dead, Engine cult will investigate.

---

#### Scene 4: The Ritual of Unbinding

**Location:** Temple of the Scales, rooftop altar, under full moon

**Participants:**
- Sister Vera (performs ritual)
- Three nobles (must be present, willingly)
- The party (defends ritual)

**Setup:**

Altar arranged with:
- The soul contract (centerpiece)
- Three vials of noble blood (arranged in triangle)
- Kaine's signet ring (placed on contract)
- Moonlight illuminating scene

Sister Vera begins chanting in divine language (Thalos' liturgy).

---

**Complication: The Engine Responds**

**Round 3 of ritual (takes 5 rounds total):**

Reality cracks. Void rift opens above altar (not Veil Beyond—this is Engine's domain).

From it: **The Debt Collector** (extraplanar enforcer)

**Debt Collector** (Level 3 Elite Outsider)
- **HD Pool:** 20d6
- **Proficiency:** 3
- **Appearance:** Skeletal figure in tattered accountant's robes, ledger in one hand, scythe-chain in other
- **Attacks:**
  - **Chain Reave** (Advanced 3+): 3 successes, 3 HD damage + Bleeding (1 HD per round until treated)
  - **Calculate Debts** (Expert 4+, AOE): All PCs make Resolve check or gain "debt sickness" (disadvantage on next attack/check)
  - **Reclaim by Force** (Action): Attempts to grab contract from altar, disrupt ritual
- **Objective:** Stop ritual, reclaim contract, punish oath-breakers
- **Weakness:** Radiant/holy damage deals +1d6

**Combat + Ritual Defense Challenge:**

**Ritual Progress Tracker:**
- Round 1-2: Vera chanting, no visible effect
- Round 3: Debt Collector arrives (combat begins)
- Round 4: Contract begins smoking (breaking in progress)
- Round 5: Final chant—contract disintegrates in silver flames (success)

**Mechanical Challenges:**
- PCs must defend Sister Vera (she cannot fight, maintains concentration)
- If Vera takes damage: Concentration broken, ritual resets 1 round
- If Debt Collector reaches altar: Steals contract, ritual fails instantly
- If nobles panic (Advanced 3+ Influence to keep them calm): Ritual stutters

**Party Roles:**
- Frontline: Block Debt Collector from reaching altar
- Support: Protect Vera, heal injuries
- Control: Keep nobles from fleeing in terror

**Victory Condition:** Survive 3 rounds (Rounds 3-5) without ritual failing

---

**Ritual Completion:**

Round 5: Sister Vera's chant reaches crescendo.

*"By the Even Hand, I sever these chains! By Thalos' balance, I declare: DEBTS MUST END!"*

Contract scroll **ignites** in silver-white flames. Burns completely, ash scatters.

Debt Collector **screams** (unearthly sound), dissolves back through rift. Rift snaps shut.

Three nobles gasp simultaneously—feeling soul-bonds SNAP. Free.

Sister Vera collapses (exhausted, but alive).

**They did it. The souls are free.**

---

#### Scene 5: Consequences & Resolutions

**The Nobles' Reactions:**

**Lord Hastings:** Grateful but pragmatic.
*"You saved my soul. I'm in your debt—a non-binding one. I'll confess embezzlement quietly. Return the funds. But I won't face public execution. That's my condition."*

**Lady Corven:** Grudgingly respectful.
*"I underestimated you. And... maybe I underestimated what comes after death. Fine. I'll repay the city. Quietly. Consider this my better judgment."*

**Baron Threllis:** Overwhelmed with gratitude.
*"Thank you. Thank you. I'll confess publicly. Face justice. It's the only way I'll sleep again."*

**Outcome:** Embezzled funds (40,000+ gold) returned anonymously to city coffers. No public scandal (nobles protect themselves), but city gets money back. Justice... of a sort.

---

#### Scene 6: The Coterie's Judgment

**That Night:** Whisper finds the party.

But Whisper is not alone. **Four Coterie Enforcers** accompany them.

Whisper's voice is cold, speaking in harsh cant:
*"Le corbeau chante, mes amis. The raven sings—for you." (Danger is here)*

Switching to Common: *"You broke the deal. The nobles live. Our employers are... displeased. Furious, actually. You've made us look incompetent."*

**The Rogue's Shadowmark** is now fully visible—glowing red, marking them as oath-breaker.

**Final Choice:**

**Option A: Fight**
- Combat: Whisper (Level 3 Rogue) + 4 Enforcers (Level 2)
- Extremely difficult
- Victory = make enemy of entire Coterie (reputation ruined in underworld)
- Consequence: Must leave Korshal or constantly fight guild

**Option B: Negotiate (Expert 4+ Influence/Sovereign)**
- Offer alternative payment:
  - Future favor (bigger, more dangerous)
  - Information on Kaine's Engine cult (valuable to Coterie)
  - Gold payment (500+ silver to cover guild's reputation loss)
- OR appeal to Coterie's ethics: *"You say you don't kill innocents. Those nobles were trapped. We freed them AND got the embezzled money back. That's more justice than killing them."*

**If Negotiation Succeeds:**
- Whisper considers, hand still on blade.
- Long pause. Then, reluctantly in cant: *"...Doigts propres? Non. Pain sec."* (Clean fingers? No. Poor outcome.)
- Switching to Common: *"...The Silent Council will decide. But you've made your case. The mark stays—you owe us double now. And next time we call, you DON'T refuse. Understood?"*
- Before leaving: *"Marche dans la brume. You've earned both respect and enmity tonight. Nuit bénie... and may you never hear 'le corbeau chante' meant for you."*
- Debt extended, but not enemies

**Option C: Leverage (if PCs have evidence of WHO hired Coterie)**
- Reveal: Merchant Council hired Coterie to kill nobles (to cover THEIR embezzlement of the embezzled gold—layers of corruption)
- Threaten to expose this unless guild backs off
- Requires evidence gathered earlier (Expert 4+ Investigation)
- Whisper: *"Couteau et sourire... you play that game well."* (Knife and smile - dangerous cunning)
- *"You're playing dangerous games. Fine. Debt's paused. But you've made enemies in high places now. Watch your back, frère. The shadows can't protect you from everything."*
- As they leave: *"Nuit bénie. We'll meet again."*

**Outcome:** Coterie backs off, but party has drawn attention of Merchant Council (future antagonists)

---

#### Epilogue: The Mark Fades (Or Doesn't)

**Resolution Variations:**

**Best Outcome (Path B or C success):**
- Shadowmark fades by 75% (still visible under moonlight—debt remains, butlessened)
- Coterie relationship: Neutral /wary respect
- Nobles freed, funds returned
- Reputation in Korshal: Heroes (to some), troublemakers (to others)

**Worst Outcome (Path A, fighting Coterie):**
- Shadowmark becomes death mark (permanent, glowing red)
- Coterie hunts them
- Must flee Kors hal or go underground
- But nobles live, souls freed

**Alternate Outcome (Delivered scroll in Session 4):**
- Shadowmark completely gone
- Nobles dead (souls to Engine)
- Coterie relationship: Good (debt paid)
- Moral weight: PCs knowingly killed three people

---

**Final Scene:**

Days later. City criers announce:
- *"Mysterious benefactor returns 40,000 gold to city treasury! Defense fund restored!"*
- *"Baron Threllis confesses to embezzlement, accepts exile!"*
- *"Merchant-Lord Kaine's estate raided by Temple of the Scales—illegal contracts seized!"* (if PCs tipped off temple)

The Rogue looks at their hand, where Shadowmark once burned.

It's faint now. Not gone, but... quieter.

Sister Vera's words echo: *"Debts must end. But honor? That stays forever. You chose well."*

Campaign ends with party having made real impact on Korshal:
- Broke soul-binding contracts
- Exposed corruption (partially)
- Stood against both Coterie AND Engine cult
- Saved three souls from eternal damnation
