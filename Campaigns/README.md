# Affinity Playtest Campaigns
## Low-Level Story Arcs (Levels 1-3)

Welcome, Game Masters, to the testing grounds of Affinity! These campaigns are designed to stress-test the system's mechanics while delivering engaging stories rooted in Aeralon's rich cosmology.

---

## Campaign Overview
### 🗿 [The Hollow Below](The_Hollow_Below.md) ✨ **PARTY ORIGIN STORY**
**Tone**: Dungeon Crawl / Mystery / Ancient Ruins  
**Focus**: Balanced party spotlight, puzzle-solving, exploration, combat variety, faction politics  
**Estimated Sessions**: 5 (2 hours each)  
**Key Themes**: Respect for the past, unintended consequences, teamwork, balance and stability

**Synopsis**: The mining town of Stonebridge faces catastrophe when ambitious miners break into an ancient sealed temple, awakening stone guardians and destabilizing a ley-node. The resulting quakes threaten to collapse the entire Delve mine—the town's economic lifeline. A Fighter, Rogue, Warlock, and Paladin converge on the crisis, each bringing unique skills. Together, they must descend into **The Hollow Below**—a forgotten temple to Khuldras, the Deep Foundation—navigate trapped ruins, solve ancient puzzles, face awakened Sentinel Constructs, and decide the temple's fate: seal it forever, restore it as a pilgrimage site, or claim guardianship themselves.

**What It Tests**:
- Dungeon crawling with branching paths (multiple exploration routes)
- Puzzle-solving (logic, mechanics, weight distribution, trap disarming)
- Environmental hazards (cave-ins, ley-node reality warps, unstable terrain)
- Construct combat (non-living enemies with unique tactics)
- Social faction dynamics (divided Town Council, negotiation)
- Moral choice systems (multiple valid solutions, no "right" answer)
- Balanced class spotlight (each PC gets dedicated challenges)
- Divine magic integration (rituals, blessings, deity communication)

**Unique Mechanics**:
- **Branching Dungeon Paths**: North (combat-heavy), East (lore-heavy), West (boss encounter)
- **Ley-Node Stabilization**: Ritual challenge requiring protection and focus
- **Custodial Constructs**: Guardians that can be negotiated with, not just fought
- **Weight Puzzle Locks**: Mathematical/logic challenges to open portcullises
- **Multiple Victory Conditions**: Combat defeat OR ritual stabilization OR diplomatic resolution

**New Cosmological Elements**:
- Khuldras, the Deep Foundation (lesser deity of earth, stability, foundations)
- Stoneheart Clans (extinct pre-Sowing mountain civilization)
- Resonance Temples (structures built to stabilize ley-nodes)
- Sentinel Guardians (custodial constructs, programmed protectors)
- Ley-node mechanics (magical infrastructure, can destabilize catastrophically)

**Why Play This First**:
This campaign serves as the **party origin story**—where the Fighter, Rogue, Warlock, and Paladin first meet and forge trust through shared danger. Each character gets multiple spotlight moments, showcasing their unique abilities. The stakes are local (save a town), the challenges are appropriate for Level 2-3, and the experience establishes party dynamics before individual campaigns branch their personal stories.

After completing **The Hollow Below**, each PC receives hooks leading to their individual campaigns:
- Fighter → *The Frostmarch Vigil* (frontier garrison needs help)
- Rogue → *The Shadowmark Debt* (Coterie calls in favor)
- Warlock → *The Platinum Paradox* (Bahamut sends mission of redemption)
- Paladin → *The Moonless Covenant* (Aluneth's shrine desecrated)

A paladin receives a desperate plea from the Goddess of Memory and Tides: three Void-Anchors threaten to erase the entire region from existence.

**Key Themes**: Debt vs. freedom, honor among thieves, choices and consequences

**Synopsis**: The Coterie—Korshal's premier thieves guild—calls in an old debt. A Rogue PC bearing the Shadowmark must infiltrate Merchant-Lord Davrik Kaine's vault and steal a sealed scroll. But the "simple heist" becomes a conspiracy when the scroll is revealed to be a soul-binding contract enforced by Azravael, the Engine goddess of eternal debt. The party must navigate guild politics, plan the perfect infiltration, and ultimately choose: honor the debt and let innocents die, or break their oath and face the guild's wrath?

**Estimated Sessions**: 5 (2 hours each)  
**Key Themes**: Mercy vs. justice, debt and freedom, optimism vs. cynicism, redemption for the flawed

**Synopsis**: A gold dragonborn celestial warlock serves Bahamut with "golden retriever energy"—reflexively kind, aggressively optimistic, convinced EVERYONE deserves a second chance. When the market town of Silverbrook falls under the control of "The Broker" (a crime boss using debt and blackmail to corrupt the town guard), Bahamut sends his most unconventional champion to prove that mercy can break chains of fear better than force. The PCs must redeem corrupted guards one by one, free Captain Marcus Ironhand from blackmail, and ultimately face Aldric Vex—the charming, ruthless mastermind behind it all. Can compassion defeat cynicism? Can the fallen be lifted up? That's The Platinum Paradox.

**What It Tests**:

- **Voice of Platinum**: Force a "Moment of Truth" where enemies confront their guilt
- **Scales of Justice**: Attackers who hurt you while you defend others feel guilt (stunned)
- **Redemptive Victory**: Non-lethal defeats make enemies more receptive to reason

**New Cosmological Elements**:
- Bahamut (lesser deity of justice, honor, protection) values mercy alongside law
- Divine blessing tied to moral choices (lose power if cruel)
- Mortal corruption driven by desperation, not evil (debt, blackmail, fear)
- Redemption as CHOICE, not compulsion

### 🌳 [The Willow's Price](The_Willows_Price.md)
**Tone**: Dark Fantasy / Horror / Emotional Drama  
**Focus**: Combat, Resolve mechanics, moral choices, Priest/Shaman spotlight  
**Estimated Sessions**: 4-6  
**Key Themes**: Grief, death, the price of immortality, mercy vs. justice

**Synopsis**: A sacred Willow Tree protecting the village of Everspring is dying—poisoned by a father who bound his dead daughter's soul to its roots in a desperate bid to keep her "alive." The PCs must navigate grief-stricken antagonists, descend into a twilight root network between Mortal Weave and Verdant Verge, and decide whether to forcefully sever the binding or guide the souls to peace. All while The Bloom (a Verdant Excess) hungers to consume the village when the tree falls.

The PCs discover Harper Lustre—a warrior who bound her soul 200 years ago as eternal guardian of Spring Wood—has awakened to enforce a broken oath. Tevenholme's founders promised sustainable logging; fifty years ago, the Council ordered a mass burn. Now Harper marches on the town for judgment.

**Estimated Sessions**: 4-5

**Synopsis**: The coastal village of Tidemark faces an existential threat when the Nihil Covenant—cultists who worship the Veil Beyond itself—deface the shrine of Aluneth (Goddess of Memory, Tides, and Continuity). Memory begins to unravel: villagers forget their families, their histories, even their own names. The Goddess reaches out to a paladin in her service with a desperate plea: three Void-Anchors corrupt the land, and if not destroyed before the new moon, the entire region will be erased from existence. The PCs must investigate the shrine, track cultists through treacherous marshes, explore a forgotten lighthouse and drowned chapel, and ultimately face a Void Herald summoned from beyond reality itself.

**Estimated Sessions**: 5 (2 hours each)  
**Key Themes**: Duty vs. desperation, grief and obsession, redemption for the tragic, small-scale heroism

**Synopsis**: The frontier logging town of Coldmarch faces a crisis: something in the Pale Forest is raising the dead. Loggers vanish. Scouts disappear. Captain Frostfeld of the Winterwatch calls on a Fighter with ties to the garrison for help. The party discovers Thane Coldbrook—a grief-mad necromancer exiled years ago—is creating Frost Focus crystals to "preserve" people in undeath, believing it mercy. The PCs must track him through brutal cold, destroy his ritual sites, and ultimately confront him in his frozen sanctum. Can a broken man driven by loss be redeemed? Or must he be stopped by force? The fate of Coldmarch hangs in the balance.

**What It Tests**:
- Wilderness travel with harsh environmental conditions (cold, navigation, exhaustion)
- HD attrition from sustained exploration and combat

- Frost Ley Node (natural elemental energy, corrupted by necromancy)

## Using These Campaigns

### Standalone vs. Sequential

**Standalone Play**:
Each campaign is self-contained. Run them independently for different groups or as one-shots.

**Sequential Play**:
Running both in order creates a thematic arc:
1. **The Willow's Price** teaches players about Affinity mechanics through intense emotional stakes
2. **The Elm Convocation** expands into faction politics and long-term consequences

Recommended order: **Willow → Elm** (escalating complexity)

### Adapting for Party Composition

**Priest/Shaman-Heavy Party**:
- **Willow** is perfect (commune with souls, ritual magic, Resolve challenges)
- **Elm** works but emphasize Elder Thornweaver as mentor

**Combatant/Ranger-Heavy Party**:
- **Elm** is perfect (oaths, wilderness, honor-based combat)
- **Willow** works but emphasize combat encounters over purely social ones

**Balanced Party**:
- Both campaigns shine with diverse classes

### Difficulty Adjustments

**For New Players** (first time with Affinity):
- Reduce elite boss HD pools by 20%
- Lower skill challenge thresholds by 1 (Expert 4+ becomes Advanced 3+)
- Provide more Moonwater Draughts / HD restoration items

**For Experienced Players**:
- Add extra minions to encounters
- Increase boss Proficiency by 1
- Introduce environmental complications (shifting terrain, time limits)

### Playtesting Focus Areas

As you run these campaigns, gather feedback on:

**The Willow's Price**:
- [ ] Are Hit Dice depleting too quickly? Too slowly?
- [ ] How do Resolve losses feel in horror/emotional scenes?
- [ ] Do social encounters with tragic NPCs engage players?
- [ ] Is the Bloom Avatar boss fight balanced for Level 2 party?
- [ ] Do moral choices feel impactful or arbitrary?
- [ ] Are Priest/Shaman abilities useful throughout?

**The Elm Convocation**:
- [ ] Do opposed Resolve checks work smoothly in negotiations?
- [ ] Can parties find solutions beyond combat?
- [ ] Does Harper feel threatening but not hopeless as a boss?
- [ ] Are faction dynamics clear and engaging?
- [ ] Do wilderness skill challenges frustrate or excite?
- [ ] Are Combatant oath mechanics satisfying?

## Campaign Connections

Though set in different regions of Aeralon, subtle threads connect these campaigns:

### The Origin Story Structure

**The Hollow Below** is designed as the **party's first adventure together**—where the Fighter, Rogue, Warlock, and Paladin forge bonds through shared danger. After completing this campaign, each PC receives individual hooks leading to their specialized stories:

**Campaign Progression Path**:
1. **The Hollow Below** (Party Origin) → Party forms, establishes trust and teamwork
2. **Individual Campaigns** (run in any order):
   - *The Frostmarch Vigil* (Fighter spotlight)
   - *The Shadowmark Debt* (Rogue spotlight)
   - *The Platinum Paradox* (Warlock spotlight)
   - *The Moonless Covenant* (Paladin spotlight)

**Why This Works**:
- **The Hollow Below** gives each class equal spotlight (balanced encounters)
- Individual campaigns let one PC shine while others support
- Party has established dynamics and trust before facing personal stakes
- Each individual campaign can reference "that time with the stone guardians"

**Connection Hooks Established**:

After **The Hollow Below**, each PC receives:

- **Fighter**: Letter from Captain Frostfeld (Winterwatch needs help with undead threat)
- **Rogue**: Note from Harlan Vex → leads to Coterie recruitment in Korshal
- **Warlock**: Bahamut observes PC's respect for Khuldras → trusts them with Silverbrook redemption mission
- **Paladin**: Aluneth notes PC honored another deity's ground → calls them when shrine is desecated

**Thematic Thread - Custodial Magic**:
All five campaigns explore **guardianship and protection**:
- *Hollow Below*: Temple guardians protecting ley-node (custodial constructs)
- *Frostmarch*: Winterwatch protecting frontier (military duty)
- *Shadowmark*: Coterie "protecting" underworld order (guild law)
- *Platinum*: Warlock protecting the corrupted from themselves (mercy as duty)
- *Moonless*: Paladin protecting memory itself (divine preservation)

### Shared Themes
- **Binding Magic**: Souls bound to trees (Willow) vs. warriors bound to forests (Elm) vs. constructs bound to duty (Hollow Below)
- **The Verdant Verge**: The Bloom threatens in Willow; Spring Wood borders Verge in Elm
- **Custodial Powers**: Black Reliquary's corruption in Willow; Concordant Halls' oaths in Elm; Khuldras's temple guardians in Hollow Below
- **Price of Immortality**: Opal trapped forever (Willow); Harper enduring 200 years (Elm); Sentinel Guardians eternally vigilant (Hollow Below)
- **Forgotten Deities**: Khuldras (Hollow Below) nearly lost to memory; Aluneth (Moonless) fighting erasure; minor gods still matter
- **Unintended Consequences**: Greed breaks seals (Hollow Below); grief corrupts nature (Willow); broken oaths summon judgment (Elm); corruption spreads through desperation (Platinum)
- **Respect vs. Exploitation**: Sacred ground disturbed for profit (Hollow Below); forest exploited beyond treaty (Elm); Willow's life drained for immortality (Willow); town guard corrupted for control (Platinum)

### Cross-Campaign NPCs (Optional)

**If running both campaigns for same party**:

1. **Elder Thornweaver** (from Elm) could appear in Willow:
   - Arrives in Everspring to offer druidic aid
   - Mentions Spring Wood's recent troubles
   - Provides foreshadowing

2. **Tamble Cobblestone** (from Willow) could send message in Elm:
   - Warns PCs about misuse of binding magic
   - Offers perspective on soul-vs-purpose balance

3. **Lafsan** (from Willow) and **Harper** (from Elm) could know each other:
   - Both ancient guardians who've endured centuries
   - Lafsan mentions "another who sacrificed humanity for duty"
   - Creates thematic resonance

### Future Campaign Hooks

**From The Willow's Price**:
- The **Crown of Thorns** (mentioned in Session 5-6) becomes Level 5+ campaign
- Other victims of Thalos's binding contracts seek PCs' help
- The Black Reliquary takes interest in PCs (friend or foe?)

**From The Elm Convocation**:
- Spring Wood's new guardian faces Verdant Verge incursion
- Laurel (if redeemed) asks PCs to rescue others trapped in Verge
- Council mediator position leads to regional political intrigue

**Combined Hook**:
- Both campaigns involve binding magic → someone's collecting knowledge of these rituals
- Leads to: "The Binding War" (Level 5-7 campaign about mass soul-harvesting plot)

## Closing Notes

These campaigns are built to explore Affinity's unique d6 pool mechanics, Resolve system, and emphasis on meaningful choices. They're not about "winning"—they're about testing how the system handles:

1. **Resource attrition** (Hit Dice as health/power)
2. **Mental strain** (Resolve as psychological stat)
3. **Moral weight** (choices that matter mechanically and narratively)
4. **Class identity** (Priests channel powers, Combatants swear oaths, Rangers track wilderness)
5. **World integration** (Aeralon's cosmology isn't set dressing—it's mechanical)

Run them, break them, learn from them. Then forge new tales from the lessons.

*The armory is stocked, Wizard. Send your champions forth to test these blades against the chaos of the table. May they return with tales of glory—and lists of things we forgot to balance.*
