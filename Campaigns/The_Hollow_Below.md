## The Mining Town of Stonebridge

**Stonebridge** sits in the **Ironfoot Hills**, a region of rocky highlands rich with copper, iron, and occasional silver veins. Population: ~600 souls. The town exists for one reason: **The Delve**—an extensive mining operation that's brought prosperity for thirty years.

### The Town

**Geography**:
- Built on both sides of the **Cragrun River** (stone bridge connects them, town's namesake)
- North bank: Refineries, smelters, warehouses
- South bank: Residential district, market square, town hall
- **The Delve**: Large mining complex 1 mile west, employing 200+ workers

**Economy**: 
Mining. Stonebridge sends refined ore downriver to larger cities. Prosperity has grown steadily—until three weeks ago.

**Government**:
- **Town Council** (5 members: Mine Overseer, Merchant Guild Rep, Landowner, Militia Captain, Citizens' Representative)
- Leadership divided on current crisis (see below)

**Notable Locations**:
- **The Stonehammer Inn**: Two-story establishment, town's social hub, excellent meat pies
- **Ore & Iron Shrine**: Small temple honoring Murien of a Thousand Names (deity of craft, artisan work, and story), run by **Priestess Kara Ironshod** (Level 2 Priest)
- **Town Hall**: Council meets here; public square in front for announcements
- **The Miners' Rest**: Bunkhouse and tavern near The Delve, rough crowd
- **The Smelter District**: North bank, always smoky, metalworkers live here

## The Problem: What Lies Below

### Three Weeks Ago

Mine Shaft #7 broke through into **something else**.

The miners thought they'd hit a natural cave system—but the walls were too smooth. Too regular. The air smelled of dry stone and something older than memory. Against protocol, Foreman **Durg Blackiron** (dwarf, ambitious) led a small crew deeper to investigate.

They found:
- **Carved pillars** covered in geometric patterns (no recognizable language)
- **A massive sealed door** made of black basalt, 15 feet tall, covered in circular locks
- **Stone statues** flanking the door—warriors in archaic armor, faces blank

Durg, excited by the prospect of discovering treasure or rare minerals, ordered his crew to **break the seals**.

They succeeded.

**Big mistake.**

### What Happened Next

When the door opened:
1. The statues **moved**—they were guardians, not statues
2. A **low rumble** shook the entire mine
3. One miner was crushed when a guardian stepped forward; two more fled screaming
4. Durg barely escaped, dragging an injured man to safety

Since then:
- **Tremors** shake the town regularly (minor quakes, no major damage yet—but growing stronger)
- **Cave-ins** have collapsed three mine shafts (12 workers trapped, 4 dead, 8 rescued)
- Strange **grinding sounds** echo from Shaft #7 at night
- Miners report seeing glowing runes deep below
- Two scouts sent to investigate haven't returned

**Current Situation**:
- The Delve is closed (economic disaster for the town)
- The Town Council is **divided** on what to do (see Factions below)
- Miners are terrified; families demand action
- No one knows what they've awakened or how to stop it

### The Truth (PCs Will Discover)

The chamber below is **The Hollow Below**—an ancient temple to **Khuldras, the Deep Foundation**, a near-forgotten lesser deity of earth, stability, and buried secrets.

**Khuldras** was worshipped 800+ years ago by a now-extinct mountain civilization. When they vanished, the temple was sealed by the last priests to prevent disturbance. The seals kept the temple's guardians dormant and its ley-node stable.

Breaking the seals:
- **Awakened the Sentinel Constructs** (stone guardians programmed to protect the temple)
- **Destabilized the Ley-Node** (causing quakes)
- **Began the Resonance Cycle** (if unchecked, will trigger a catastrophic collapse)

**The temple must either be properly re-sealed or its ley-node stabilized by someone with divine authority.**

---

## Campaign Hook: Four Strangers, One Crisis

The party arrives in Stonebridge via the trade road. They can be:
- **Traveling together** (met on the road, heading to next town)
- **Coincidentally arriving separately** (all passing through)
- **Specifically hired** (Council sent messengers seeking help)

### Opening Scene: The Tremor

As the PCs cross the stone bridge into town:

> *The ground shudders. Not violently—a deep, rolling tremor like the earth shifting in its sleep. Pebbles dance on the bridge stones. A child cries out. Merchants grab at wobbling crates.*
> 
> *A woman shouts from a balcony: "That's the third one this morning!"*
> 
> *As the tremor subsides, you notice: Everyone looks exhausted. Worried. On edge.*

**Investigation (Basic 2+) or just asking locals:**
- The tremors started three weeks ago after "something happened at The Delve"
- The mine's been closed ever since—economic catastrophe
- People are scared; some families are leaving town
- The Town Council is meeting today to decide what to do

**If PCs head to the town square:**
They arrive just as the Council meeting becomes a **public shouting match**.

---

## Session 1: Tremors & Choices

### Scene 1: The Divided Council

**Location**: Town Hall steps, public square

The five Council members stand on the steps, arguing loudly while ~100 townsfolk watch:

#### The Two Factions

**"Seal It" Faction:**

**1. Priestess Kara Ironshod** (Level 2 Priest of Murien, dwarf):
- *"We disturbed something sacred! You don't break ancient seals and expect no consequences! We should collapse Shaft #7, seal the breach, and apologize to whatever gods we've offended!"*
- Believes the quakes are divine punishment
- Wants immediate shutdown and ritual cleansing

**2. Militia Captain Torvald Greystone** (Level 3 Combatant, human):
- *"I've got four dead miners and eight still traumatized. We're NOT going back down there. Seal it, post guards, move on."*
- Prioritizes safety over profit
- Doesn't want more people dying "exploring ruins"

**3. Citizens' Rep Mira Ashford** (Level 1 Sovereign, human):
- *"My people are terrified! Children aren't sleeping! We need to FIX this, not ignore it!"*
- Represents common folk; wants security and stability
- Open to sealing OR clearing, whichever is safer

**"Explore It" Faction:**

**4. Mine Overseer Durg Blackiron** (Level 2 Combatant, dwarf):
- *"That chamber is enormous! We've barely scratched the surface! There could be treasure, lost knowledge, rare ores! We can't just walk away!"*
- Ambitious, greedy, but not evil
- Feels guilty about the deaths but convinced potential rewards justify risk

**5. Merchant Guild Rep Harlan Vex** (Level 2 Rogue, human):
- *"If we seal the mine, Stonebridge's economy collapses. We'll be a ghost town in two years. We NEED to go back—carefully—and secure whatever's down there."*
- Motivated by economics; closing the mine = losing investment
- Willing to hire professionals (like the PCs!)

#### The Argument

When the PCs arrive, the argument is at a fever pitch:

**Kara**: *"You broke sacred ground! You think you can just take what you want without consequence?!"*

**Durg**: *"We didn't know! But now we DO know there's something valuable—"*

**Torvald**: *"VALUABLE?! Four men are DEAD, Durg!"*

**Harlan**: *"And sealing it won't bring them back! But it WILL destroy this town! We need professionals—adventurers, delvers, people trained for this!"*

**Mira**: *"Then FIND some! The tremors are getting worse!"*

As if on cue: Another tremor. Stronger than before. A display shelf crashes in a nearby shop. People panic.

**Harlan spots the PCs** (they look capable, armed, etc.):
*"You there! You look like you've seen worse than a shaky floor. Are you looking for work?"*

### Scene 2: The Hire

The Council (reluctantly united) offers the PCs a job:

**The Task**: 
- Descend into Shaft #7
- Investigate the chamber and what was awakened
- Determine if the threat can be neutralized
- Recommend whether to seal the breach or proceed with caution

**Payment**:
- **100 gold upfront** (shared among party)
- **200 gold upon completion** (shared)
- **One magic item from the town vault** (if they succeed)
- **Free lodging and meals** at the Stonehammer Inn during the job

**Timeline**: 
"Before the quakes bring down the whole town."

**Factions**:
- **Kara offers** a *Blessing of the Craftmaker's Ward* before they descend (+1d6 vs. traps/environmental hazards, lasts 24 hours)
- **Durg provides** maps of Shaft #7 and sketches of what he saw
- **Torvald assigns** two militia guards to secure the mine entrance (won't go inside)

**Individual Character Hooks**:

- **The Fighter**: Torvald pulls them aside: *"You've got the look of someone who's held a line before. If this goes bad, the town's militia is twenty farmhands with spears. We'll need real fighters."* (Establishes Fighter as tactical leader)

- **The Rogue**: Harlan approaches quietly: *"The Council wants a 'report.' I want to know what's actually down there. You look like someone who notices things others miss. Keep your eyes open—there's a bonus in it for you."* (Encourages investigation/looting)

- **The Paladin**: Kara speaks to them privately: *"I sense faith in you. Whatever's below, it was sealed for a reason. If you can, honor the sanctity of that place. Don't just rob it."* (Moral compass established)

- **The Warlock**: As the Warlock passes, they **feel a pull**—a faint resonance, like their patron's magic recognizes something below. The sensation is curious, not threatening, but insistent. *Something divine is down there.*

### Scene 3: Preparation & Investigation

The PCs have time to prepare before descending. Several options:

#### A) Interview Durg Blackiron

**Location**: The Miners' Rest tavern

Durg is drinking heavily, guilt-ridden but defensive. **Influence check (Basic 2+)** to get him talking:

**What he reveals:**
- *"The door had seven circular locks. We broke six—then I got impatient and just smashed the seventh with a pickaxe."*
- *"When it opened... the air changed. Felt heavier. Older."*
- *"The statues came alive slow-like. One second stone, next second MOVING. Crushed Bron like an insect."*
- *"I saw more hallways beyond. Pillars. Runes that glowed blue. It's HUGE down there."*
- *"The grinding sounds at night? That's more of 'em. Waking up. Moving around."*

**Advanced (3+) Influence or Insight:**
- Durg knows he screwed up; he's terrified of being blamed for the deaths
- He DID see something glinting deeper in—possibly treasure—but won't admit it (fears being called greedy)

#### B) Talk to the Survivors

**Location**: Priestess Kara's temple, injured miners recovering

Two miners survived the guardian attack:

**Jenna Coalhand** (human miner, traumatized):
- Saw the guardian crush Bron; can barely speak about it
- Keeps repeating: *"It didn't have a face. Just blank stone. Like nobody was home."*
- Describes the statues: *"Eight feet tall. Armor carved into their bodies. Moved like they were underwater—slow but unstoppable."*

**Ryk Hammerfall** (dwarf miner, broken arm):
- Angrier than scared
- *"We shouldn't have touched that door. FELT wrong. The runes were a warning, not a decoration."*
- **Lore check (Advanced 3+):** Ryk recognizes the geometric patterns as pre-Sowing era construction (800+ years old)

#### C) Examine the Maps

Durg's sketches show:
- Shaft #7 descends 200 feet, ends at a **breached wall** (the miners broke through here)
- Beyond: **The Antechamber** (50x50 ft, pillared hall, the sealed door at the far end)
- **The door is now open** (guardians emerged from here)
- Hallways extend beyond the door into darkness
- Durg marked where the guardian crushed Bron (bloodstain still there as warning)

#### D) Gather Supplies

The town provides:
- **Ropes** (300 ft)
- **Torches** (20)
- **Rations** (5 days per person)
- **Healing poultices** (restore 1d6 HD each, 3 available)
- **Mining tools** (picks, hammers, crowbars—useful for breaking obstructions)

**Rogue-Specific**: 
Militia Captain Torvald has a **thieves' tools set** confiscated from a bandit last year. He loans it to the Rogue: *"I hear you've got clever fingers. Don't tell me what you did before this job—I don't want to know."*

### Scene 4: The Descent

**Location**: The Delve, Shaft #7 entrance

The mine entrance is eerie:
- Abandoned equipment scattered (miners fled in panic)
- Support beams reinforced but creaking
- Distant **grinding sounds** echo from below
- Faint blue glow visible deep down

**Environmental Challenge**: 
The descent is dangerous. The shaft has wooden scaffolding, ladders, and cart-tracks descending 200 feet.

**Group Athletics/Acrobatics check (Basic 2+):**
- **Success**: Safe descent
- **Failure**: Minor cave-in! Everyone takes 1d6 damage from falling debris; one character must spend 1 HD or fall 20 feet

**At the Bottom**: 

The PCs reach the breached wall. Beyond it: **The Antechamber**.

> *The air changes as you step through the broken wall. Cooler. Drier. The smell of worked stone, untouched for centuries. Your torchlight reveals a pillared hall stretching 50 feet ahead. Eight stone columns support a vaulted ceiling carved with geometric spirals.*
> 
> *At the far end: the door. Fifteen feet of black basalt, now hanging open. Bloodstains mar the floor where a miner died.*
> 
> *And flanking the doorway: two figures. Eight feet tall, carved from gray stone, wearing ancient armor. Their faces—blank. Smooth. Featureless.*
> 
> *They don't move. But you have the distinct feeling they're **aware** of you.*

**The Sentinel Guardians** are dormant for now (see below). They won't attack unless the party:
- Attacks them first
- Tries to damage the temple
- Advances deeper without offering respect

**Rogue Spotlight**: 
**Investigation check (Basic 2+)** to notice:
- The pillars are inscribed with runes (language unknown, but pattern suggests instructions or warnings)
- The bloodstain is three weeks old (dried, but still visible)
- Faint tracks in dust lead PAST the door into the darkness beyond
- The door's locks were smashed (crude work)

**Warlock Spotlight**:
When the Warlock approaches the door, they **feel the resonance stronger**:

> *Your patron's magic stirs. You sense... architecture of divinity. This place was built to honor something. The magic here is old—older than kingdoms—but not malevolent. Protective. Territorial.*

**Religion/Lore check (Moderate 3+):** 
The geometric patterns match pre-Sowing religious iconography. This is a temple. The guardians are custodial constructs—not evil, but absolute in their duty.

### Scene 5: First Contact—The Guardians

If the PCs try to proceed past the door without caution, the **Sentinel Guardians** activate:

**Read aloud**:
> *The statues' heads turn. Slow. Grinding. Stone-on-stone scraping fills the chamber. Blue runes flare to life across their bodies. They step forward—not aggressive, but blocking the path.*
> 
> *One raises a hand. Palm out. Universal symbol: **STOP.***

**These constructs are NOT mindless killing machines.** They are **programmed guardians** protecting the temple. They will:
- Block the party from advancing
- Demand identification/proof of authority
- Attack ONLY if threatened or if party persists in trespassing

#### Option A: Communication (Social/Puzzle Challenge)

**The guardians don't speak**—but they respond to:
- **Religious gestures** (kneeling, offering respect)
- **Divine magic** (Paladin/Warlock casting spells shows "authority")
- **Solving a lock-puzzle** (see below)

**Paladin Spotlight**:
If the Paladin kneels and offers a prayer (to ANY god of order/earth/craft), the guardians pause. One tilts its head—processing.

**Warlock Spotlight**:
If the Warlock casts a divine spell (e.g., *Sacred Flame*, even if it's just a demonstration), the guardians recognize celestial magic. One lowers its hand slightly—less hostile.

**Fighter Spotlight**:
If the Fighter steps forward in a non-threatening stance and addresses the guardians respectfully (e.g., *"We mean no disrespect. We're here to fix what was broken."*), the guardians... wait.

**Rogue Spotlight - THE PUZZLE**:

The guardians gesture to the door's locks. Seven circular mechanisms, now smashed.

**Investigation check (Moderate 3+):**
- The locks are geometric puzzles—each ring rotates, aligning patterns
- Six were broken carefully; the seventh was smashed with brute force (Durg's mistake)
- If the seventh lock were repaired and aligned correctly, it might signal non-hostile intent

**Thieves' Tools + Intelligence check (Moderate 3+, Rogue gets +1d6):**
- **Success**: The Rogue manages to realign the broken mechanism using spare parts from their tools. The locks click into alignment. The guardians step aside.
- **Failure**: The mechanism is too damaged. The guardians remain blocking.

#### Option B: Fight (Combat Encounter)

If the party attacks, tries to force past, or fails to communicate:

**COMBAT: SENTINEL GUARDIANS (2)**

**Sentinel Guardian** (Construct, Level 3 Elite)

- **Hit Dice**: 40 HD
- **Armor**: Heavy (Moderate 3+ to hit)
- **Speed**: Slow (20 ft movement)
- **Immunities**: Poison, psychic, fatigue

**Attacks**:
- **Stone Fist** (Basic Attack): +3d6, deals 3 successes = 3 HD damage
- **Crushing Grasp** (Advanced Attack): +4d6, on hit grapples target (Escape = Moderate 3+ Athletics)

**Special Traits**:
- **Immovable**: Gains +2d6 to resist being moved
- **Stone Skin**: Ignore first 2 damage from any single attack
- **Custodial Protocol**: Will not pursue fleeing enemies beyond the Antechamber

**Tactics**:
- Guardians fight defensively, blocking the doorway
- Focus on grappling/restraining, not killing (unless party is clearly hostile)
- If reduced to 10 HD, a guardian retreats deeper into the temple

**Victory Conditions**:
- Destroy both (hard for Level 2-3 party)
- Reduce one to 10 HD (it retreats; other follows)
- Flee back to the mine shaft (guardians don't pursue)

**Fighter Spotlight During Combat**:
The Fighter can use tactical commands to direct allies:
- Suggest flanking (grants +1d6 to ally's attack)
- Protect weaker party members (interpose action)
- Recognize constructs are slow (kiting strategy grants advantage)

---

## Session 2: Halls of the Deep Foundation

### Scene 1: Beyond the Door

Whether through puzzle-solving, negotiation, or combat, the PCs gain passage beyond the Antechamber.

**Read aloud**:
> *Beyond the door, a long hallway descends gently. The walls are carved with precision—geometric patterns flowing in hypnotic spirals. Every ten feet, alcoves contain stone braziers. As you approach, they **ignite** with cold blue flame, lighting your path.*
> 
> *The hall stretches 100 feet ahead, ending at a circular chamber. You hear the distant grinding again—closer now. And beneath it, a low hum. Rhythmic. Like a heartbeat made of stone.*

**Investigation check (Basic 2+):**
- The braziers are magical (ancient enchantments, still functional)
- The carvings depict hands holding stones, builders raising temples, earth swallowing the dead (funerary imagery)
- No signs of looting or previous disturbance (this place has been sealed for centuries)

### Scene 2: The First Trial - The Collapse Hall

**Location**: 100 feet down the hallway

The corridor ahead has partially collapsed. Stone blocks obstruct the path, leaving a narrow gap near the ceiling (3 feet wide, 20 feet long).

**Environmental Challenge**:

**Option A - Brute Force**:
Group Athletics check (Expert 4+) to move the blocks safely.
- **Success**: Path cleared, 1 hour of work
- **Failure**: Cave-in! Everyone takes 2d6 damage; lose another hour

**Option B - Climb Over (Rogue Spotlight)**:
The Rogue can squeeze through the gap above. **Acrobatics check (Moderate 3+)**:
- **Success**: Rogue reaches the other side, finds mechanism to open a side passage (bypasses collapse)
- **Failure**: Rogue gets stuck; party must pull them free (wastes time, alerts guardians deeper in)

**Option C - Find the Maintenance Passage**:
**Investigation check (Moderate 3+)**: Notice a hidden panel in the wall (maintenance access). Leads around the collapse.

### Scene 3: The Ritual Chamber

**Location**: Circular chamber, 60 feet in diameter

> *The hallway opens into a circular room. At the center: a raised dais with a stone altar. Carved upon it: a mountain swallowing a serpent. Around the altar, seven stone pedestals—each with a carved bowl.*
> 
> *The hum is louder here. It comes from beneath the floor. The stones themselves vibrate faintly.*
> 
> *Three exits lead from this chamber: North, East, West. Each sealed by a stone portcullis.*

**This is the temple's hub.** 

**Investigation (Basic 2+):**
- The bowls on the pedestals are empty (once held offerings)
- The altar is dedicated to **Khuldras, the Deep Foundation** (Lore check Moderate 3+ identifies the deity)
- The portcullises have no visible mechanisms (opened from beyond)

**Warlock Spotlight - Divine Insight**:

When the Warlock touches the altar, they receive a **VISION**:

> *You see priests in gray robes placing stones in the bowls. Each stone glows softly. The portcullises rise. A voice—deep, resonant, like tectonic plates grinding—speaks:*
> 
> *"**Balance. Foundation. Offering.**"*
> 
> *Then the vision ends.*

**The Puzzle**:
To open the portcullises, the party must place **stones of equal weight** in **balanced patterns** on the pedestals.

**Scattered around the chamber**: 21 stones of varying sizes (1 lb, 2 lb, 3 lb, 5 lb, etc.)

**Solution** (three separate locks):
- **North Gate**: 7 lbs total (any combination summing to 7)
- **East Gate**: 10 lbs total
- **West Gate**: 15 lbs total

**Rogue/Scholar Spotlight**:
- **Investigation/Logic check (Moderate 3+)** to deduce the pattern
- **Rogue's steady hands**: Advantage on placing stones precisely (some bowls are pressure-sensitive—too heavy or too light triggers a reset)

**Failure Penalty**:
Wrong combination = portcullis slams shut, minor quake (1d6 damage to everyone, alert guardians)

### Scene 4: Branching Paths

The party must choose which portcullis to open first (they can return to open others later):

**North Path - The Guardian's Vault** (Combat-Heavy):
Leads to a barracks where dormant Sentinel Guardians rest. If awakened, they attack. Contains weapons and armor (treasure).

**East Path - The Archive Chamber** (Investigation/Lore-Heavy):
Leads to a library of stone tablets. Contains information about Khuldras, the temple's purpose, and how to stabilize the ley-node (critical info). Also contains lore about the original civilization.

**West Path - The Ley-Node Chamber** (Mixed Challenge):
Leads directly to the source of the quakes—the destabilized ley-node. Dangerous environmental hazards and a boss encounter.

**DM Note**: The party will likely split attention or make multiple trips. That's fine. Each path has different spotlight opportunities.

---

## Session 3: Paths of Stone

The party explores two of the three paths (typically East for info, then one of the others).

### Path A: The Archive Chamber (East)

**Hallway**: 80 feet long, lined with alcoves containing stone tablets.

**Rogue Spotlight - Trapped Hall**:
**Investigation check (Moderate 3+)** to notice:
- Floor tiles are pressure sensitive
- Stepping on the wrong sequence triggers dart traps

**Thieves' Tools + Awareness check (Moderate 3+):**
- **Success**: Rogue disables traps or identifies safe path
- **Failure**: Darts fire! 2d6 damage, DC3+ Athletics to dodge

**The Archive**:

> *The hall ends at a circular room. Walls floor to ceiling with stone tablets, each carved with text. A stone lectern at the center holds a larger tablet—a title plate.*
> 
> *The air is perfectly still. Dust covers everything.*

**Warlock/Paladin Spotlight - Translation**:

The tablets are in Old Terran (ancient language). **Lore check (Moderate 3+)** or casting *Comprehend Languages* reveals:

**The Lore of Khuldras**:
- *Khuldras, the Deep Foundation, Lesser Deity of Earth, Stability, and Hidden Truths*
- *Worshipped by the Stoneheart Clans (mountain civilization, extinct 800 years ago)*
- *Khuldras taught that civilization requires firm foundation—literal and metaphorical*
- *This temple was a **Resonance Temple**—built atop a ley-node to stabilize the surrounding region*

**The Sealing Ritual**:
- *When the Stoneheart Clans vanished (plague? war? unknown), the priests sealed the temple*
- *The seals kept the Sentinel Guardians dormant and the ley-node stabilized*
- *Breaking the seals without divine authority = catastrophic destabilization*

**How to Fix It** (Critical Info):
Three options described:
1. **Re-seal the temple** (requires ritual components + divine magic)
2. **Stabilize the ley-node** (requires trained earth mage OR divine channeling)
3. **Assume guardianship** (someone must take the priests' place—permanent commitment)

**Treasure**:
- Stone tablet with *Ritual of Foundation* (grants caster ability to stabilize ley-nodes)
- Ancient holy symbol of Khuldras (grants +1d6 to Religion checks involving earth/stone)

**Fighter Spotlight** (if present):
The Fighter finds a tablet describing the Sentinel Guardians:
- *"Custodians eternal. They know not malice, only duty. To pass them, show respect. To command them, bear authority. To destroy them, bear guilt."*

### Path B: The Guardian's Vault (North)

**Hallway**: 60 feet long, opens into barracks.

**The Barracks**:
> *A long rectangular room. Stone bunks line the walls. Weapon racks (empty) stand at attention. At the far end: six alcoves. In each, a **Sentinel Guardian** stands dormant—eyes dark, bodies still.*

**Stealth Challenge (Rogue Spotlight)**:

If the party tries to sneak through: **Group Stealth check (Moderate 3+)**.
- **Success**: Pass through without waking guardians
- **Failure**: Guardians activate (combat)

**COMBAT (If Triggered): DORMANT SENTINELS (6)**

**Dormant Sentinel** (Construct, Level 2)

- **Hit Dice**: 25 HD
- **Armor**: Medium (Basic 2+ to hit)
- **Speed**: 20 ft
- **Attacks**:
  - **Stone Fist**: +2d6, deals 2 successes = 2 HD damage

**Special**:
- **Sluggish Awakening**: First round, only 2 sentinels act (others waking). Each subsequent round, +2 join combat.
- **Retreat Option**: If party flees back to Ritual Chamber, guardians don't pursue.

**Fighter Spotlight - Tactical Combat**:
- Suggest bottleneck strategy (force guardians single-file through doorway)
- Call targets (focus fire on one at a time)
- Defend squishy allies (interpose, protect Warlock/Rogue)

**If Party Defeats/Bypasses Guardians**:

**Treasure Room** (behind the barracks):
- **300 gold in ancient coins**
- **Stone Greatsword +1** (weapon focus: earth, deals bonus damage to creatures standing on stone)
- **Guardian's Pauldrons** (Medium armor, grants +1d6 to resist being moved/knocked down)
- **3 Healing Potions** (restore 2d6 HD each)

### Path C: The Ley-Node Chamber (West)

**Hallway**: 100 feet, slopes downward. Temperature increases (uncomfortably warm).

**Environmental Hazard**:
The ley-node's instability is causing **reality warps**. 

**Awareness check (Basic 2+)** each 20 feet:
- **Failure**: Character is disoriented (lose 1 Resolve as space bends unnaturally)

**The Ley-Node Chamber**:

> *The passage opens into a vast cavern—natural stone mixed with worked architecture. At the center, suspended in midair: a **sphere of crackling blue energy**. The ley-node. It pulses erratically, each pulse sending tremors through the floor.*
> 
> *Around it: three towering figures. Nine feet tall. Stone. Heavily armored. Runes blazing.*
> 
> *These are not dormant. They are **ACTIVE**. And they see you.*

**BOSS ENCOUNTER: AWAKENED WARDENS (3)**

**Awakened Warden** (Construct, Level 3 Elite)

- **Hit Dice**: 50 HD
- **Armor**: Heavy (Moderate 3+ to hit)
- **Speed**: 30 ft (faster than basic guardians)
- **Attacks**:
  - **Rune Blade** (Basic Attack): +4d6, deals 3 successes = 3 HD damage
  - **Tremor Stomp** (Advanced Attack, Recharge 5-6): Ground slam. Everyone within 20 ft makes Moderate (3+) Athletics check or falls prone and takes 2 HD damage.

**Special**:
- **Ley-Empowered**: Regenerate 5 HD at the start of each turn while within 30 ft of ley-node
- **Custodial Fury**: +1d6 to attacks if temple has been desecrated (looted/damaged)

**Environmental Factor**:
Each round, roll 1d6:
- **1-2**: Ley-pulse. Everyone makes Basic (2+) Resolve check or loses 1 Resolve (reality warps)
- **3-4**: Quake. Difficult terrain; Athletics/Acrobatics checks to move safely
- **5-6**: Stable round (no environmental effect)

**Fighter Spotlight - Leadership**:
- Direct party to attack one Warden at a time (focus fire)
- Call out environmental hazards
- Hold the line (interpose between Wardens and casters)

**Warlock/Paladin Spotlight - Stabilize the Node**:

Instead of fighting all three, a caster can attempt to **stabilize the ley-node** (if they learned the ritual from the Archive).

**Ritual Action** (requires 3 consecutive rounds of concentration):
- Caster must stand within 10 ft of ley-node
- Each round: **Religion/Lore check (Expert 4+)**
- If interrupted (taking damage, failing check), ritual resets

**If successful**: Ley-node stabilizes. Wardens deactivate (shut down peacefully). Quakes stop.

**Rogue/Fighter Role**: Protect the caster for 3 rounds (hold off Wardens).

**Victory Conditions**:
1. Defeat all 3 Wardens (combat victory)
2. Stabilize the ley-node (ritual victory)
3. Flee (retreat, but quest isn't complete)

---

## Session 4: The Heart of Stone

### Scene 1: Aftermath of the Ley-Node

**If Ley-Node Stabilized**:
The quakes stop. The blue sphere softens to a gentle glow. The Wardens kneel, then return to their alcoves (dormant again).

**Read aloud**:
> *The sphere's wild pulsing ceases. The light softens—steady, rhythmic, like a heartbeat. The grinding sound fades. Silence. The stone beneath your feet feels... solid. Calm.*
> 
> *From the sphere, a voice—not words, but **impression**: Gratitude. Relief. Protection.*

**If Wardens Defeated**:
The ley-node remains unstable but begins to slowly stabilize (the Wardens' presence was sustaining the chaos). Quakes lessen but don't fully stop.

**Paladin Spotlight - Divine Communication**:

The Paladin feels **Khuldras's presence** (faint, ancient, grateful):

> *A presence touches your mind—vast, patient, old beyond measure. Not a god in full, but an echo. Khuldras, diminished but aware.*
> 
> *You sense: This place was built to protect. The seals were mercy. The disturbance was... misunderstanding. Mortals seeking wealth, not knowing what lay beneath.*
> 
> *A question forms: "Will you repair what was broken?"*

**The Choice** (Entire Party):

**Option A: Re-Seal the Temple**
- Return to the surface
- Perform the Ritual of Foundation (using lore from Archive)
- Collapse Shaft #7, bury the entrance
- Temple sleeps again for centuries

**Consequences**:
- Town safe (quakes stop)
- No further exploration/treasure
- Durg is relieved (avoids blame)
- Council's "Seal It" faction wins

**Option B: Cleanse and Restore the Temple**
- Stabilize ley-node (if not already done)
- Sanctify the altar (religious ritual)
- Leave temple accessible but protected (Sentinels remain active guardians)
- Appoint a caretaker (NPC or PC?)

**Consequences**:
- Town safe (quakes stop)
- Temple becomes a pilgrimage site (tourism/economic boost)
- Durg claims credit for "discovery"
- Require ongoing protection/management

**Option C: Claim the Temple**
- One PC accepts **Khuldras's Mantle** (become the temple's guardian)
- Gain divine powers but bound to protect the temple
- Cannot leave for more than 1 week/year

**Consequences**:
- PC becomes NPC/retires from adventuring (permanent commitment)
- Temple flourishes under new guardian
- Town gains powerful protector
- PC's sacrifice is heroic but costly

**Option D: Walk Away**
- Leave everything as-is
- Return to surface, report findings
- Let the Council decide

**Consequences**:
- Quakes resume (ley-node still unstable)
- Town must seal or risk continued danger
- Party doesn't get full payment

### Scene 2: The Return to Light

**Climbing Back**:
The return journey through Shaft #7 is uneventful (unless they chose Option D—then tremors make it hazardous).

**At the Surface**:
The two militia guards cheer as the party emerges. Word spreads quickly: *"They're back!"*

### Scene 3: Report to the Council

**Location**: Town Hall, Council assembled

The party presents their findings:
- What the chamber is (temple to Khuldras)
- What was awakened (Sentinel Guardians, ley-node destabilization)
- What they did (stabilized/sealed/claimed/etc.)
- Their recommendation

**Council Reactions**:

**If Sealed**:
- **Kara Ironshod**: *"You honored the sacred. Well done."* (approving)
- **Torvald Greystone**: *"The tremors have stopped. That's all I needed to hear."* (relieved)
- **Durg Blackiron**: *"...I suppose that's for the best."* (guilty but relieved)

**If Restored**:
- **Harlan Vex**: *"A pilgrimage site? Tourism! This could be incredible for business!"* (excited)
- **Mira Ashford**: *"As long as it's safe. No more quakes?"* (cautious)
- **Durg Blackiron**: *"I'll oversee the entrance security personally."* (trying to redeem himself)

**If Claimed** (PC became guardian):
- **Kara Ironshod**: *"A sacred calling. The gods have chosen."* (reverent)
- **Torvald Greystone**: *"We'll station guards to assist."* (practical)
- Entire town treats the PC as a living saint

**Fighter Spotlight - Strategic Debrief**:
Torvald specifically asks the Fighter: *"From a tactical standpoint—if we'd sent militia, what would have happened?"*
- Fighter can explain how dangerous it was
- Establishes Fighter's expertise; Torvald offers militia training position (future hook)

**Rogue Spotlight - Private Conversation**:
Harlan pulls the Rogue aside: *"You kept your eyes open, right? Anything down there worth... following up on?"*
- If Rogue mentions treasure, Harlan offers future "investment opportunities"
- If Rogue says nothing, Harlan grins: *"Discreet. I like that."*

**Warlock Spotlight - Blessing Received**:
If the Warlock stabilized the ley-node, they receive **Khuldras's Favor** (permanent boon):
- *Mark of the Deep Foundation*: +1d6 to checks involving stone, earth, stability, or protection magic
- Once per day, cast *Mold Earth* (minor terrain manipulation)

**Paladin Spotlight - Divine Approval**:
Kara Ironshod speaks to the Paladin privately:
- *"I felt Khuldras's presence when you returned. Faint, but there. You were chosen for this. Your god approves of your patron recognizing another deity's domain."*
- Aluneth (the Paladin's deity) sends a brief vision: waves smoothing over sharp stones, tides respecting the shore (approval of respecting sacred ground)

**The Council delivers**:
- **300 gold total** (100 upfront + 200 completion)

### Scene 2: The Town Celebrates

- Children ask for stories of "the stone monsters"
- Durg Blackiron buys the party a round, apologizes again

**NPC Moments**:

**Priestess Kara**:
- Thanks the Paladin specifically: *"You showed that faith isn't about one god—it's about honoring the divine wherever you find it."*

**Captain Torvald**:
- Offers the Fighter a *Wintermark Badge* (honorary militia rank): *"If you ever settle down, we'd be honored to have you train our guards."*

**Harlan Vex**:
- Slips the Rogue a note: *"If you're ever looking for work—discrete work—ask around for the Vex Consortium. We appreciate talent."* (future adventure hook)

**Durg Blackiron**:
- Approaches the Warlock: *"You felt it down there, didn't you? The... sacredness. I didn't. I'm sorry for that. I'll do better."* (genuine remorse)

### Scene 3: Individual Epilogues

**The Fighter**:
Captain Torvald approaches: *"Those four individuals—your companions—they followed your lead in the fighting. You've got command presence. Ever think about joining a garrison permanently?"*
- The Fighter receives an open invitation to Stonebridge's militia (future retirement option)

**The Rogue**:
A young miner (the survivor, Jenna Coalhand) approaches shyly: *"You saved us. I saw what you did—disarming those traps, opening the locks. I... I want to learn that. Not to steal! To help. To be useful."*
- The Rogue gains a potential apprentice/follower (if they want)

**The Paladin**:
While praying at Kara's temple, the Paladin receives a vision from their deity:
- *"You honored another's ground. This is what faith means: recognizing the sacred, even when it is not mine. Walk this path."*
- Gain **Blessing of Recognition**: +1d6 to Religion checks involving OTHER deities (not your own)

**The Warlock**:
Khuldras's presence touches the Warlock one last time:
- *"Mortal who speaks for the skies: you stood for the earth. Balance. The Weave thanks you."*
- The Warlock's patron (whichever god/entity) acknowledges: *"You represented me well. Other powers notice."*
- Mechanical benefit: +1 to Influence checks with divine beings (gods respect you now)

### Scene 4: The Road Ahead

The party is free to stay or leave. 

**If They Stay**:
- Stonebridge offers lodging, food, work opportunities
- The temple (if restored) can become a base of operations
- Potential future quests: protect the temple, negotiate with earth elementals, explore deeper chambers

**If They Leave**:
- The Council provides a trade wagon escort job (next adventure hook)
- Rumors of other sealed ruins in the region (future dungeons)
- Harlan Vex's note leads to intrigue elsewhere

**The Final Scene**:

> *You stand at the Stonebridge bridge, sun rising over the Ironfoot Hills. Behind you, smoke rises from the Delve—miners returning to work, cautiously but optimistically. The tremors have stopped. The town breathes easier.*
> 
> *Ahead, the trade road stretches toward new horizons. You're no longer strangers to each other—you fought together, bled together, solved impossible problems together.*
> 
> *The stone beneath your feet feels solid. The foundation holds.*
> 
> *Where will you go next?*

**Campaign Hooks for Future Stories**:

- **The Fighter**: Receives a letter from Coldmarch (*The Frostmarch Vigil*)—Captain Frostfeld needs help
- **The Rogue**: Coterie contacts them in next city (*The Shadowmark Debt*)—you owe a favor
- **The Warlock**: Hears rumors of corruption in Silverbrook (*The Platinum Paradox*)—Bahamut is displeased
- **The Paladin**: Reports of memory loss in Tidemark (*The Moonless Covenant*)—Aluneth calls for aid

**Themes**:
1. **Respect for the Past**: Don't disturb sacred ground lightly
2. **Unintended Consequences**: Greed (Durg) causes disaster for entire community
3. **Balance & Stability**: Khuldras's domain—civilization requires strong foundations
4. **Teamwork**: Each PC's skills are essential (can't succeed alone)
5. **Moral Complexity**: No villain—just misunderstanding and desperation

## Connections to Other Campaigns

**The Hollow Below** serves as the party's **origin story**—their first adventure together. Events here set up future individual campaigns:

**For the Fighter** (*The Frostmarch Vigil*):
- Captain Frostfeld hears about the PC's competence protecting Stonebridge
- Sends recruitment letter: *"If you can face stone guardians, you can handle frostbitten undead"*

**For the Rogue** (*The Shadowmark Debt*):
- Harlan Vex is connected to the Coterie (unknowingly)
- His "business opportunities" note is a Coterie recruitment probe
- When the Rogue reaches Korshal, the Coterie already knows their name

**For the Warlock** (*The Platinum Paradox*):
- Bahamut observes how the Warlock handled Khuldras's temple (respecting another deity's domain)
- This reinforces the patron's trust in the PC's mercy-focused approach
- When corruption in Silverbrook begins, Bahamut specifically chooses this Warlock

**For the Paladin** (*The Moonless Covenant*):
- Aluneth notes her champion's respect for Khuldras (honoring memory/sacred ground)
- When Aluneth's own shrine is defaced, she knows the Paladin will act
- The Paladin's experience with void-touched ley-nodes (stabilization) prepares them for void-anchors

**Thematic Thread**:
All five campaigns deal with **custodial magic**—powers/entities that protect/preserve:
- Hollow Below: Temple guardians protecting ley-node
- Frostmarch: Winterwatch protecting frontier
- Shadowmark: Coterie "protecting" the underworld
- Platinum: Warlock protecting the corrupted from themselves
- Moonless: Paladin protecting memory itself

---

## Conclusion

**The Hollow Below** is a balanced introductory campaign for a mixed-class party. It tests core Affinity mechanics (combat, exploration, social, puzzles) while giving each PC dedicated spotlight moments.

The stakes are **local but meaningful**: Save a town from economic ruin and geological disaster. The threat is **appropriate for Level 2-3**: Tough but beatable constructs, solvable puzzles, dangerous but navigable hazards.

Most importantly: **Multiple solutions exist**. The party can seal the temple, restore it, claim it, or negotiate. No "right" answer—only choices with consequences.

This is how heroes are born: Not by saving the world, but by standing for a community when no one else can.

**"The foundation holds because someone chooses to hold it."**  
—Inscription on Stonebridge's memorial plaque (erected after the quake crisis)

---

*Campaign designed for Level 2-3 characters with LOCAL stakes, balanced spotlight distribution, and appropriate scope for 10 hours of gameplay.*

*May your dice roll true, your foundations stay firm, and your parties find glory in the Hollow Below.*
