## Campaign Hook

In the frontier village of **Everspring** (named for its endless spring bloom), a sacred **Willow Tree** stands at the village center - a natural anchor preventing The Verdant Verge's ecological chaos from spilling into the Mortal Weave. For generations, the tree has kept the village safe, its roots drinking from both realms, maintaining balance.

**But three days ago, the Willow began to die.**

Its leaves blacken and curl. Its roots writhe in pain. And at night, villagers hear it *screaming* in a language older than words. If the tree dies, The Bloom (one of the Verdant Excesses) will surge across the border, consuming Everspring in unstoppable growth within hours.

The village priest, **Tamble Cobblestone**, has called for aid. She believes someone—or something—has poisoned the Willow's roots. The PCs arrive as hired investigators and protectors, but they quickly discover this is no mere poisoning. **Someone has bound a soul to the tree's roots, and the soul is in agony.**

---

## Story Progression

### Arc 1: The Investigation (Sessions 1-2)
**Level 1 - Learning the Basics**

#### Session 1: Arrival & Discovery

**Opening Scene**: 
The PCs arrive at Everspring during the spring festival that should celebrate the Willow's bloom—but the air reeks of rot, black sap oozes from the tree's bark, and the once-beautiful canopy droops like broken wings. Villagers whisper in clusters, eyeing the nearby forest fearfully. Some pack belongings, preparing to flee.

**Tamble Cobblestone** (Level 4 Priest of Aluneth) greets them:
- *"Thank the tides you've come. The Willow screams at night—real screams, not wind. And yesterday, three villagers tried to 'mercy-kill' it with axes. I had to stop them. They don't understand: if the tree dies, the Bloom devours us all. I need you to find what's killing it—and stop it."*

**Investigation Roleplaying Opportunities**:
- **Interview Villagers**: Use social encounters to learn fears, rumors, and clues
  - Required successes vary (2+ for friendly, 3+ for frightened, 4+ for hostile)
  - Success reveals: Strange figures near tree at night, merchant caravan passed through recently, local hermit warned this would happen
  
- **Examine the Willow**: Requires Nature knowledge or Priest/Shaman connection
  - Advanced (3+) action to commune with tree
  - Success: Tree is in *agony*—something foreign is bound within its roots, burning it from inside
  - Expert (4+) Success: Catch glimpse of memory—a young woman's face, twisted in terror
  
- **Track the Night Visitors**: Ranger/Combatant tracking skills
  - Basic (2+) action to find footprints
  - Lead to abandoned root cellar at edge of village

**Combat Encounter**: Root Cellar Guardians
- **2-3 Thorn-Rot Creatures** (manifestations of the Willow's pain)
  - HD Pool: 3d6 each
  - Proficiency: 1
  - **Attack - Lashing Vine** (Basic, 2+): 2 success required, 1 HD damage + grapple on 3+ successes
  - **Special**: When destroyed, burst of black sap (all adjacent must defend or lose 1 Resolve)
  
**Cellar Discovery**: 
Hidden beneath moldy sacks: A ritual altar with dried blood, a silver locket containing a portrait of a young woman, and a journal.

**Journal Reveals** (if read):
- Written by **Ricton Garveston**, a traveling merchant
- His daughter **Opal** died three months ago (illness)
- He sought a way to bring her back
- Made contact with someone who promised "eternal life through the Willow"
- Final entry: *"The ritual is complete. Opal lives within the roots now. She feeds the tree as the tree feeds her. We can be together forever."*

**Revelation**: Ricton bound his dead daughter's soul into the Willow's roots, believing she could "live" as part of the tree. But the binding was imperfect—Opal's anguished soul is poisoning the tree from within.

#### Session 2: The Hermit & The Truth

**The Hermit - Lafsan**:
An ancient druid living at the forest's edge (Level 6 Shaman). Villagers feared him, calling him "strange." He's lived here for decades, maintaining the boundary between realms.

**Lafsan knows**:
- The binding ritual was taught by a traveler from The Gloam—a psychopomp gone rogue who sells "death-cheating" rituals
- Reversing the binding requires entering the Willow's *root network*—a liminal space between Mortal Weave and Verdant Verge
- Opal's soul must *choose* to leave, or be forcibly severed (killing her again)
- Ricton has fled, but he visits the tree each night, whispering to his "daughter"

**Lafsan Offers**:
- Teach one PC a special ritual to enter root network (he's too old to go himself)
- Provides *Moonwater Draught* (restores 2 HD when drunk)
- Warns them: The Bloom is *watching*—it wants the Willow to die so it can surge through

**Playtesting Note**: This session tests social mechanics, Resolve loss from difficult emotional revelations, and prepares party for dungeon-crawl.

---

### Arc 2: Into the Roots (Sessions 3-4)
**Level 2 - Path Board Unlocked**

#### Session 3: The Root Network Descent

**The Ritual**:
At midnight, beneath the Willow, the PC who learned Lafsan's ritual must cast it (Expert 4+ action, requires ritual components from Lafsan). On success, the ground beneath the party *softens*, and they sink into a twisted knot of roots.

**Root Network Environment**:
- Dim bioluminescent glow from veins in roots
- Oppressive humidity
- Occasional pulses of *pain* from Willow (all make Resolve check or lose 1 Resolve)
- Six interconnected root chambers leading to central nexus

**Encounters**:

1. **Root Chamber One - Memory Echoes**:
   - Ghostly visions of Opal's final days (illness, suffering, father's grief)
   - Social/Resolve challenge: Observe without being overwhelmed
   - Failure = lose 1 Resolve, Success = gain insight (advantage on future Opal interaction)

2. **Root Chamber Two - The Bloom's Scouts**:
   - **4 Pollination Sprites** (scouts from Verdant Verge)
     - HD Pool: 2d6 each
     - Proficiency: 1
     - **Attack - Spore Cloud** (Basic, 2+): 1 success required, 1 HD damage, inflicts "Rooted" (movement halved next turn on 2+ successes)
     - **Tactics**: Harass and slow party, not kill—The Bloom wants witnesses to Willow's death
   - **Loot**: Sprite essence (ingredient for potions)

3. **Root Chamber Three - The Binding Site**:
   - Ritual circle carved into massive root
   - Silver threads connect circle to pulsing central root
   - **Skill Challenge**: Trace threads to find Opal's location (requires 3 cumulative successes with Advanced 3+ actions)
   - Failure adds complication: Alarm alerts Ricton

4. **Root Chamber Four - Ricton's Vigil**:
   - **Ricton Garveston** (Level 3 Sovereign, grief-mad)
     - HD Pool: 5d10
     - Proficiency: 2
     - Resolve: 2 (already damaged by guilt)
     - **Attack - Desperate Slash** (Basic, 2+): 2 successes required, 2 HD damage
     - **Power Word: "She Lives!"** (Advanced, 3+): Shout that bolsters his Resolve by 1, usable twice
     - **Breakdown**: If reduced to 0 Resolve before 0 HD, collapses sobbing rather than fighting
   - **Roleplay Option**: Convince Ricton to help free Opal (opposed social check, target his Resolve)
     - Success: He helps party reach nexus
     - Failure: Fight to incapacitate

5. **Root Chamber Five - The Entangled**:
   - Previous victims of the rogue psychopomp's rituals
   - **3 Soul-Bound Husks** (zombie-like, but aware and suffering)
     - HD Pool: 4d8 each
     - Proficiency: 1
     - **Attack - Grasping Plea** (Basic, 2+): 1 success required, 1 HD + inflict "Haunted" (disadvantage on next Resolve check)
     - **Mercy Option**: Use Priest power word or Shaman nature magic to *release* them without combat

6. **Root Chamber Six - The Nexus (Boss Arena)**:
   - Central chamber where all root threads converge
   - **Opal's Soul** hovers at center, trapped in crystallized sap cocoon
   - Willow's *heartwood* pulses weakly above

#### Session 4: The Price of Life

**The Confrontation**:

When party enters nexus, Opal's soul *wakes*. She manifests as ghostly echo of teenage girl, face twisted in pain and confusion.

**Opal's Dialogue**:
- *"Father? No... you're... who... it hurts. Everything hurts. Why won't he let me go?"*
- *"I wanted to die. I was ready. But he... he wouldn't let me. Now I'm... burning. The tree is dying because I'm burning it."*
- *"Please. Please make it stop."*

**Choice Point - The Party Must Decide**:

**Option A: Sever the Binding (Forceful)**
- Requires Expert (4+) action (magical or physical)
- 4 successes needed
- On success: Binding shatters, Opal's soul released to The Gloam (Aralys takes her peacefully)
- Consequence: Willow *wounded* but begins healing immediately
- Ricton (if present) screams in anguish, losing all Resolve → collapses → must be carried out

**Option B: Ritual Release (Compassionate)**
- Opal must *consent* to passing
- Social encounter: Convince her it's okay to let go (target her Resolve)
- Ricton (if present) must also let go—social encounter targeting his Resolve
- Requires 5 cumulative successes across conversation(s)
- On success: Opal fades peacefully, whispering "thank you" as Aralys's veil wraps around her
- Consequence: Willow *unharmed*, begins blooming immediately
- Ricton finds peace (or at least accepts grief)

**Option C: Preserve the Binding (Dark)**
- If party somehow chooses to *keep* Opal bound (prevent tree death temporarily)
- Requires convincing Opal to endure suffering "for greater good"
- Opposed social check against her pleas for mercy
- Consequence: Willow stabilizes for 1d6 weeks before dying anyway
- Ethical nightmare; Tamble and Lafsan condemn party
- **This is a trap option**—shows players choices have moral weight

**The Bloom's Interruption**:

Regardless of choice, *during* the resolution attempt:

**The Bloom's Avatar arrives** (drawn by Willow's death-scent):

- **Bloom-Touched Orchid Beast** (Level 4 Elite Enemy)
  - HD Pool: 12d8 (Expert-tier boss)
  - Proficiency: 2
  - Resolve: 3
  - Actions per turn: **4** (2 + half party size, rounded down for party of 3-4)
  - **Attack - Strangling Vines** (Advanced, 3+): 2 successes, 2 HD damage, grapple on 3+ successes
  - **Attack - Pollination Burst** (Expert, 4+): 3 successes, 3 HD to all in 10-yard cone, Resolve check or lose 1 Resolve (overwhelming beauty)
  - **Special - Rapid Bloom**: Each turn, Bloom-orchids sprout in 5-yard radius (difficult terrain)
  - **Tactics**: Interrupt party's ritual/severing attempt, forcing them to split attention

**Encounter Design**:
- Party must BOTH deal with Opal's binding AND fight off Bloom Avatar
- Creates tension: Do we finish ritual first or stop immediate threat?
- Bloom Avatar *wants* to prevent Willow's healing (if healed, Bloom loses foothold)

**Resolution**:
- If Opal released and Avatar defeated: Willow *heals*, pushing back Bloom influence
- If Avatar defeated but Opal still bound: Temporary victory (problem returns)
- If Avatar wins: Party knocked unconscious, dragged to surface by Lafsan, Willow continues dying

### Arc 3: Consequences (Sessions 5-6)
**Level 3 - Aftermath & Next Steps**

#### Session 5: The Rogue Psychopomp

**If party succeeded**:
Everspring celebrates. Willow blooms overnight. Festival resumes.

**But Tamble brings news**:
The rogue psychopomp who sold Ricton the binding ritual has been tracked to nearby **Deephaven** (a dwarven mining town). He's selling "eternal life" rituals to desperate families. More trees, more souls bound. The problem is spreading.

**Investigation Leads**:
- Travel to Deephaven (1 day journey)
- Infiltrate smuggling operation
- Discover psychopomp's identity: **Thalos Hallwinter** (fallen servant of The Black Reliquary)
- He's collecting bound souls as "currency" to bargain with something in The Gloam

**Social & Investigation Session**:
- Test social mechanics in urban environment
- Introduce faction play (dwarven miners vs. merchant guilds vs. undercity smugglers)
- Build toward confrontation

#### Session 6: The Black Market & Final Choice

**Deephaven Undercity Encounter**:

Thalos operates from **The Slasher's Den** (black market auction house built into abandoned mine shaft).

**Thalos Hallwinter** (Level 5 Priest of The Black Reliquary, corrupted)
- HD Pool: 7d8
- Proficiency: 3
- Resolve: 4
- **Power Word: "Debt Recalled"** (Advanced, 3+): Target must make Resolve check or lose 1 HD as "payment" (necrotic soul-drain)
- **Power Word: "Contract Sealed"** (Expert, 4+): Bind target in metaphysical chains (grappled, cannot move until they make successful Resolve check)
- **Attack - Reaper's Touch** (Advanced, 3+): 2 HD damage, steals 1 HD on 4+ successes (adds to his pool)
- **Summon Contract-Bound Shades**: Can call 2d4 soul-husks as minions (2d6 HD each)

**The Auction Hall Fight**:
- Multi-wave encounter
- Wave 1: Thalos's guards (3 smugglers, 3d8 HD each)
- Wave 2: Thalos himself + 2 Contract-Bound Shades
- Environmental: Caged souls that can be freed mid-fight (tactical choice: help them or focus on boss?)

**Final Choice**:

When Thalos falls:
- His contracts scatter across ground (binding documents)
- Each contract represents a soul he's bound
- **Burning them releases souls** (including Opal's "echo" if she was severed violently)
- **Keeping them grants dark knowledge** (learn binding magic—Path Board node option, but corrupts)

**Campaign Resolution**:

**Success States**:
1. **Heroic**: Released all souls, stopped Thalos, saved Everspring → Reputation +2 in region, Lafsan offers training, Tamble gives blessing
2. **Pragmatic**: Saved Everspring but kept some contracts for power → Mixed reputation, Lafsan disappointed, power gained
3. **Failure**: Willow died, Everspring evacuated or consumed → Refugees scatter, guilt, The Bloom advances

**XP Award**: Party reaches Level 3 by campaign end

**Reward Options**:
- **Magic Items**: Moonwater Vials (restore 2 HD when drunk, 3 uses), Willow Branch Talisman (+1d6 to Nature checks)
- **Path Board Unlocks**: Custom nodes related to choices made (Mercy Path, Nature Bond Path, Shadow Bargain Path)
- **Faction Standing**: Gained allies in Everspring, Deephaven, or The Black Reliquary (if they took contracts)

## Themes & Playtesting Goals

### Themes
1. **Grief & Acceptance**: Ricton's inability to let go creates cascading tragedy
2. **The Price of Immortality**: Eternal life through binding causes eternal suffering
3. **Balance**: Mortal Weave requires death as much as life
4. **Mercy vs. Justice**: Is forceful severing or compassionate release the answer?

### Playtesting Mechanics Tested
1. **Combat Encounters**: Mix of minions (thorn-rots, sprites) and bosses (Bloom Avatar, Thalos)
2. **Social Encounters**: Resolve-based conversations with Opal, Ricton, NPCs
3. **Resolve System**: Multiple Resolve checks throughout (horror, grief, mental strain)
4. **Environmental Tactics**: Root network chambers, difficult terrain, multi-wave fights
5. **Action Tiers**: Basic attacks, Advanced abilities, Expert boss powers
6. **Hit Dice Attrition**: Long dungeon crawl tests resource management
7. **Path Board Progression**: Players earn nodes at Levels 2 and 3, see mechanical growth
8. **Moral Choices**: No "correct" answer; consequences reflect actions

### GM Notes for Playtesting
- **Session Length**: Aim for 3-4 hour sessions
- **Encounter Balance**: Adjust HD pools based on party performance
- **Roleplay Emphasis**: Opal's scene should be emotional—don't rush
- **Player Agency**: Multiple solutions exist (combat, social, magical); reward creativity
- **Pacing**: Arc 1 = investigation, Arc 2 = dungeon crawl, Arc 3 = boss fight + fallout

*May your playtesting reveal the strengths and flaws of the system, as the Willow revealed the price of defying death.*
