## Silverbrook: A Town in Need

**Silverbrook** is a prosperous market town (population ~800) at the crossroads of three major trade routes. It's known for its weekly markets, skilled craftsmen, and—until recently—fair and honest governance.

### The Town

**Geography**:
- Built where three roads meet
- Silverbrook River runs through center (namesake, fishing industry)
- Central market square (hub of activity)
- Town hall, modest temple district, residential quarters
- Well-maintained walls (mostly symbolic, no major threats)

**Economy**: Trade hub. Merchants stop here to rest and resupply. Weekly markets draw farmers and artisans from surrounding area. Prosperity attracts... attention.

**Government**:
- **Town Council** (5 members: merchants, craftmasters, landowners)
- **Magistrate** (appointed by council, judge and lawkeeper)
- **Town Guard** (20 guards, led by Watch Captain)

**Current Problem**: The town guard, once fair and protective, has become corrupt. "Protection fees," arbitrary arrests, confiscated goods, intimidation. The council is ineffective—either complicit or intimidated.

---

## The Corruption

### Captain Marcus Ironhand

**Watch Captain Marcus Ironhand** (Level 4 Combatant) was once a good man. Honest. Dedicated. But three years ago, his daughter fell ill with wasting sickness. Healers couldn't help. Medicine costs drained his savings.

**Then came The Broker**.

A mysterious figure offered Marcus a deal: gold for his daughter's healing, in exchange for... cooperation. Medical supplies appeared. His daughter recovered. And Marcus owed a debt.

Now, Marcus enforces "The Broker's" will through the town guard, collecting protection money and silencing dissent. He HATES himself for it, but believes he has no choice. The Broker owns him.

**Marcus's Corruption**:
- Not evil by nature—compromised by desperation and debt
- Rationalizes: "I'm keeping my family safe"
- Struggles with guilt (drinks heavily, avoids eye contact)
- Deep down, wants to be FREE but sees no way out

### The Corrupted Guard

Of the 20-guard force, **12 have been corrupted** (the other 8 either resist quietly or are unaware):

**Sergeant Dara Blackwood** (Level 3 Combatant):
- Marcus's second-in-command
- Opportunist who ENJOYS the power corruption brings
- No moral qualms—in it for personal gain
- Unlikely to be redeemed (but maybe?)

**Guard Tyler Ashford** (Level 2 Combatant):
- Young guard (age 19), pressured into corruption by seniors
- Uncomfortable with what he's doing
- Wants out but fears retaliation
- PRIME candidate for redemption

**Guard Kessa Stonewright** (Level 2 Combatant):
- Former stonemason, joined guard to support sick mother
- Blackmailed into cooperation (Broker threatened her mother)
- Acts tough but secretly desperate
- Will help heroes if shown a way out

**The Other 9 Corrupted Guards**: Mix of opportunists, cowards, and desperate people. Most could be redeemed if given the chance.

### The Broker

**Aldric Vex** (Level 5 Rogue/Crime Boss):
- Runs organized crime in Silverbrook (smuggling, extortion, thievery)
- Uses fear and debt to control people
- NOT a fiend or supernatural threat—just a VERY good criminal
- Charismatic, intelligent, ruthless

**Vex's Operation**:
- Controls docks (smuggling), market (protection rackets), guard (enforcement)
- Operates from **The Silver Stag**, an upscale tavern he owns
- Fronts as a "successful merchant"—town council suspects but can't prove
- Uses debt and blackmail, not violence (violence is messy and draws attention)

**Vex's Weakness**: Arrogant. Believes he's untouchable. Underestimates "do-gooders."

---

## Campaign Hook: The Golden-Hearted Warlock

### The Warlock's Nature

**[The Warlock PC]** is a gold dragonborn celestial warlock, pact-bound to **Baham ut**, the Platinum Dragon (lesser deity of justice, honor, and protection).

**Personality**: "Golden retriever energy"—reflexively kind, aggressively optimistic, believes EVERYONE deserves a second chance.

**Bahamut's Perspective**: Perpetually exasperated but cannot deny they get results. This dragonborn proves that mercy can be as effective as law.

### The Call

The Warlock passed through Silverbrook two weeks ago and noticed the corruption. Instead of ignoring it, they:
1. Tried to report abuses to Captain Marcus (was stonewalled)
2. Confronted a guard harassing a merchant (was threatened)
3. Asked Bahamut for guidance

**Bahamut's Response** (in a dream vision):

*"You see rot where others see order. Good. Corruption thrives when good people look away. I could send paladins to CRUSH this evil... or I can send YOU to HEAL it. Prove that kindness can redeem even the fallen. Turn enemies into allies. Break this cycle of fear and debt not with a blade, but with HOPE."*

*"But know this: if redemption fails, THEN comes justice. Go. Show them mercy. And if mercy fails... show them what it means to defy a servant of the Platinum Dragon."*

**The Warlock gains**: **Bahamut's Mark of Redemption** (divine boon, see below)

**The party**: The Warlock recruits/travels with the party, explaining the mission: "We're going to save Silverbrook from corruption—by saving the people DOING the corruption from themselves!"

---

## Divine Boon: Bahamut's Mark of Redemption

Before departing for Silverbrook, Bahamut grants the Warlock (and party) his blessing.

### The Ritual (10 minutes, requires dawn light and oath-swearing)

The Warlock prays, and Bahamut's presence manifests (brief divine touch):

*"Swear this: You will offer mercy before violence. You will seek redemption before retribution. You will illuminate the darkness in hearts—and THEN, if they choose darkness still, you will illuminate it with dragonfire. Understood?"*

### Blessing Granted: **Mark of Redemption** (lasts through campaign)

**The Warlock Specifically**:
- **Redeeming Presence** (Passive): When you successfully convince an enemy to stand down or switch sides, you and all allies regain 1d6 HD (mercy heals)
- **Voice of Platinum** (1/session): You can declare a "Moment of Truth"—target one enemy, make an opposed Influence vs. their Resolve. If you win, they're forced to confront their guilt and either surrender or flee (cannot attack for 1 round)
- **Scales of Justice** (1/combat): When you take damage meant for an ally (interposing yourself), the attacker must succeed on a Resolve save (Moderate, 3+) or be stunned by guilt (lose next action)

**All Party Members**:
- **Platinum's Favor**: +1d6 on social checks when showing mercy or offering second chances
- **Redemptive Strike**: If you non-lethally defeat an opponent (drop them to 0 HD without killing), they become MUCH more likely to listen to reason afterward (mechanical advantage on post-combat Influence checks)

**Bahamut's Warning**: *"This blessing wanes if you become cruel. Mercy isn't weakness—but neither is it foolishness. Save those who CAN be saved. And stop those who WON'T."*

---

## Story Progression

### Session 1: Return to Silverbrook
**Level 2 - Investigation & First Contact**

#### Scene 1: Arrival at the Market

The party arrives at Silverbrook's market square on market day. The town is bustling but tense:
- Guards patrol in pairs (intimidating presence)
- Merchants pay "fees" at guard checkpoints (disguised extortion)
- Common folk avoid eye contact with guards

**Perception (Basic, 2+)**: Notice:
- Guards pocketing money at merchant stalls
- A baker reluctantly handing over coins ("protection fee")
- Townspeople whispering nervously, watching guards

**If party intervenes** (stop extortion, question guards):
- Guards become hostile: "Move along. Official town business."
- If pressed, they threaten arrest: "Interfering with the watch. That's a crime."

**First Encounter: A Merchant in Need**

**Mira Copperkettle** (middle-aged smallfolk merchant) approaches the party discreetly:

*"You're new here. Word of advice: don't make trouble for the guards. They... they're not what they used to be. Just pay the fees, keep your heads down, and move on. Trust me."*

If party engages her (Influence/Persuasion, Basic 2+):
- She explains: "Three years ago, the guard was GOOD. Honest. Then Captain Marcus changed. Started demanding 'taxes' for stall space, charging for 'protection.' Council won't help—they're either scared or bought."
- She mentions: "If anyone could help, it's **Father Torin** at the Temple of Valkora. He still speaks out. But even he's careful now."

**Hook**: Party can investigate further (talk to Father Torin, observe the guard, research "The Broker").

---

#### Scene 2: The Temple of Valkora

**Father Torin** (Level 3 Priest, elderly human):
- One of the few who openly opposes the corruption (carefully)
- Provides sanctuary to those who can't pay "fees"
- Knows Marcus personally—trained with him years ago

**Torin's Information**:

*"Marcus was a good man once. I've known him for twenty years. Then his daughter got sick, and everything changed. He became... desperate. Then secretive. Now he's the Broker's enforcer."*

*"The Broker? No one knows his real identity. He operates from shadows, using debts and blackmail to control people. Marcus isn't the only one under his thumb—half the council is compromised too."*

*"If you want to help Silverbrook, you need to FREE Marcus from the Broker's hold. Break the chain of fear. And maybe—just maybe—Marcus will remember who he used to be."*

**Torin offers**:
- Safe house (party can stay at temple)
- Information network (knows which guards are conflicted vs. truly corrupt)
- Moral support: "If you can redeem even ONE of them, it proves mercy works."

---

#### Scene 3: The Alley Shakedown

**That evening**, party witnesses:

**Guard Tyler Ashford** (young guard, Level 2) harassing **Old Man Gregor** (elderly shopkeeper) in an alley:

*"Come on, Gregor. You're three days late on your protection payment. The Captain doesn't like when people are late. Just... just give me the coin and I'll leave you alone."*

Gregor, trembling: *"I don't HAVE it. Business has been slow."*

Tyler, conflicted: *"Look, I don't want to do this, but if I don't collect, Sergeant Blackwood will—"*

**Party can intervene** (several options):

**Option 1: Pay the 'Fee' Themselves** (10 gold):
- Tyler takes it reluctantly: "You shouldn't have done that. But... thanks. Gregor, you're clear. For now."
- Tyler lingers, clearly uncomfortable

**Option 2: Intimidate Tyler** (Intimidation, Moderate 3+):
- Success: Tyler backs down: "Fine. I'll tell them Gregor fled town. Just—don't make this worse."
- Failure: Tyler calls for backup (Sergeant Blackwood arrives with 2 more guards—escalates)

**Option 3: Persuade Tyler** (Influence, Moderate 3+):
- Success: Tyler breaks down: "I HATE this. I didn't sign up to shake down old men. But if I don't, they'll... they'll hurt my family. I'm TRAPPED."
- Warlock can offer hope: "What if we could free you? Break the cycle?"
- Tyler, desperate: "How? The Broker owns Captain Marcus. Marcus owns US. There's no way out."

**If Tyler is convinced to ally**:
- He reveals: "The Broker meets Marcus every week at The Silver Stag. Private room, back entrance. If you want to know who he is, that's where you'd start."
- He warns: "But Marcus is loyal to the Broker. He'll defend him. You'd have to get through Marcus first—and Marcus is GOOD."

**End Scene 1** with party knowing:
1. Marcus is the key
2. The Broker operates from The Silver Stag
3. Some guards (like Tyler) CAN be redeemed

---

#### Scene 4: Investigating The Silver Stag

**The Silver Stag** is an upscale tavern/inn:
- Well-appointed, expensive clientele
- Owned by "Aldric Vex," a charming "merchant"
- Guards frequent it (off-duty... or on Broker business)

**Party can**:
- **Stake out the tavern** (Stealth/Perception, Moderate 3+): Observe Marcus entering via back door, meeting someone in private
- **Infiltrate** (Disguise/Stealth, Expert 4+): Sneak into back rooms, overhear conversation
- **Talk to staff** (Persuasion, Moderate 3+): Barmaid hints that "Mr. Vex has powerful friends"

**If party successfully spies on a meeting** (difficult, Expert 4+):

They overhear Marcus and Vex:

**Vex**: *"The council is getting restless, Marcus. Keep them quiet. If anyone starts asking questions, make an example."*

**Marcus** (tired, bitter): *"I'm not your thug, Vex. I did what you asked. My debt is paid."*

**Vex**: *"Your debt is paid when I SAY it's paid. Remember what happens if you refuse. Your daughter is healthy now. Would be a shame if her illness... returned."*

**Marcus** (defeated): *"...Fine. I'll handle it."*

**Revelation**: Vex is blackmailing Marcus by threatening his daughter.

**End Session 1** with party planning: How do we FREE Marcus from Vex's control?

---

### Session 2: Turning the Tide
**Level 2-3 - Building Alliances & Small Confrontations**

#### Opening: Planning the Redemption

Party regroups at Father Torin's temple. They know:
- Aldric Vex is The Broker
- Marcus is blackmailed (threat to his daughter)
- Some guards can be redeemed

**Strategy Options**:
1. **Redeem guards first** (build allies, weaken Vex's enforcement)
2. **Confront Marcus directly** (risky, but could flip him)
3. **Expose Vex publicly** (gather evidence, present to council)
4. **Protect Marcus's daughter** (remove Vex's leverage)

**Torin's advice**: *"Start small. Redeem the guards who are conflicted. Build a coalition of people willing to stand up. Then, when you face Vex, you won't be alone."*

---

#### Scene 1: Redeeming Guard Kessa Stonewright

**Guard Kessa** (Level 2 Combatant, former stonemason):
- Blackmailed (Broker threatened her sick mother)
- Patrols the east market alone (opportunity to approach privately)

**Party approaches Kessa** (during her patrol):

Kessa, defensive: *"What do you want? I'm on duty."*

**Social Encounter: Win Kessa Over**

**Influence (Moderate, 3+ opposed by Kessa's Resolve)**:

**Arguments that work** (advantage):
- "We know you're being blackmailed. We can help."
- "Your mother is safe—we can protect her."
- "You don't have to be trapped. There's another way."

**Arguments that fail** (disadvantage):
- "You're a criminal" (she's defensive, not proud)
- "Just betray the Broker" (too risky without protection)

**If successful**:

Kessa breaks: *"I HATE this. I was a mason—I BUILD things. Now I'm tearing down people' s lives. But my mother... if Vex finds out I betrayed him, he'll hurt her. Can you REALLY protect her?"*

**Party can**:
- **Move her mother to temple** (Father Torin offers sanctuary)
- **Assign party member to guard her** (if they have resources)
- **Promise to end Vex's influence** (requires trust, Persuasion Moderate 3+)

**If Kessa is convinced**:
- She becomes an **ally** (provides intel, assists in future fights)
- Reveals: "Sergeant Blackwood is the enforcer. She ENJOYS this. Don't expect to redeem her. But Tyler, Joren, and Maeve? They're like me. Trapped."

**If party FAILS to convince Kessa**:
- She reports to Blackwood
- Later scenes become harder (guards on alert)

---

####Scene 2: The First Real Fight

**That night**, party is ambushed by **Sergeant Blackwood** and 3 corrupted guards:

Blackwood: *"You've been causing trouble. Talking to the wrong people. The Captain wants a word—but I think you're resisting arrest."*

#### Combat Encounter 1: Street Ambush

**Setup**:
- **Sergeant Dara Blackwood** (Level 3 Combatant, Elite)
- **3 Corrupted Guards** (Level 2 Combatants)
- Location: Dark alley, limited escape routes
- Objective: Defeat OR convince to stand down

**Sergeant Blackwood (Level 3 Elite)**:
- **HD**: 10d10
- **Attacks**: Longsword (Heavy, Basic, 3d6, 2 HD damage)
- **Tactics**: Commands guards, fights aggressively, NO interest in surrender

**Corrupted Guards** (Level 2):
- **HD**: 6d10each
- **Attacks**: Shortsword (Light, Basic, 2d6, 1 HD damage)
- **Behavior**: Follow Blackwood's orders, but will flee if she's defeated or if offered mercy

**Mid-Combat Redemption Option**:

If Warlock uses **Voice of Platinum** (1/session ability) on a guard (not Blackwood):
- Target guard is confronted with their guilt
- Must choose: surrender or keep fighting
- **If they surrender**: Combat becomes easier, Redeeming Presence heals party 1d6 HD

**Victory Conditions**:
- Defeat all enemies
- Convince guards to stand down (Blackwood will NOT surrender)
- Drive them off (if they take heavy losses, they retreat)

**After Combat**:

**If Blackwood is captured/defeated**:
- She spits defiance: "You think you've won? Vex OW NS this town. He owns Marcus. You're just making it worse."
- Can be handed to Father Torin for holding

**If guards surrendered**:
- They're terrified: "Blackwood will report this. Vex will retaliate. We need protection."
- Party can offer sanctuary at temple (builds allies)

**Consequence**: Marcus KNOWS the party is interfering. Next session, he'll confront them.

**End Session 2** with tension rising: Marcus knows. Vex knows. The conflict is escalating.

---

### Session 3: The Captain's Choice
**Level 3 - Major Confrontation & Moral Choice**

#### Opening: Marcus Comes Calling

**Morning at Father Torin's temple**:

**Captain Marcus Ironhand** arrives (alone, unarmed, but tense):

*"We need to talk. NOW. In private."*

---

#### Scene 1: Confronting Marcus

**Private room, just Marcus and the party** (Father Torin mediates):

Marcus, exhausted: *"You're destroying everything I've built. Every guard you turn, every payment you disrupt—it puts my FAMILY at risk. Do you understand? Vex doesn't bluff. If I lose control, he'll hurt my daughter. So STOP."*

**This is THE KEY MOMENT**:

#### Social Encounter: Redeeming Marcus Ironhand

**Opposed Influence Check (Expert, 4+ opposed by Marcus's Resolve)**:

This is HARD. Marcus is desperate and entrenched. But he WANTS to be free.

**Arguments that resonate** (advantage):
- "We can protect your daughter. Vex can't touch her if she's under guard."
- "You're a good man trapped by circumstances. Let us help you escape."
- "How long until Vex asks you to do something WORSE? Where's the line?"
- **Warlock specifically**: "Bahamut sees your heart. You're not evil—you're desperate. But desperation doesn't have to define you. Choose NOW: be free or stay a slave."

**Arguments that fail** (disadvantage):
- "You're a coward" (he knows, makes him defensive)
- "Just arrest Vex" (he's tried, Vex has contingencies)
- "You're a bad father" (cruel and counterproductive)

**If party succeeds** (requires GOOD roleplay and probably Warlock's abilities):

Marcus breaks down:

*"I HATE what I've become. Every day I look in the mirror and see a stranger. But my daughter... if Vex hurts her because of me, I'll never forgive myself. Can you REALLY protect her? Can you REALLY stop him?"*

Party must convince him they CAN (requires concrete plan):
- Move his daughter to temple OR out of town entirely
- Gather evidence against Vex to present to regional authorities
- Coordinate with redeemed guards for a simultaneous move

**If Marcus is convinced**:
- He becomes an **ally**
- He provides: Names of Vex's other blackmail victims, location of Vex's hidden ledger (evidence), layout of The Silver Stag
- He says: *"I'll help. But we do this FAST. Once Vex knows I've turned, he'll burn everything down."*

**If party FAILS**:
- Marcus leaves: "I'm sorry. I can't risk it. Leave Silverbrook. Please."
- Session proceeds with Marcus as reluctant antagonist (won't kill party, but will obstruct)

**Assuming Marcus is redeemed** (the intended path):

---

#### Scene 2: Moving Marcus's Daughter

**Immediate action**: Get Elara (Marcus's daughter, age 12) to safety.

**Skill Challenge: Extract Elara**:

Marcus explains: *"She's at home, watched by two of Vex's thugs (disguised as 'guards'). We need to get her out without Vex knowing until it's too late."*

**Options**:
1. **Stealth extraction** (Stealth, Expert 4+): Sneak in, get Elara out quietly
2. **Distraction** (Deception, Moderate 3+): Create diversion, extract during chaos
3. **Direct confrontation** (Combat): Fight the two thugs (Level 2 Rogues)

**If successful**:
- Elara is moved to secret location (temple or outside town)
- Marcus is FREE of leverage

**If failed**:
- Vex learns of betrayal EARLY (escalates final confrontation)

---

#### Scene 3: Gathering Evidence

Marcus reveals: *"Vex keeps a ledger—every bribe, every blackmail, every debt. It's in his office at The Silver Stag, locked safe. If we get that, we can prove his crimes to the regional magistrate."*

**Infiltration Mission**:

**The Silver Stag (Heist)**:

**Setup**:
- Back entrance (locked, Lockpicking Moderate 3+ or key from Marcus)
- Private hallway (2 guards, can be avoided with Stealth Expert 4+ or talked past with Deception)
- Vex's office (locked safe, Lockpicking Expert 4+ or combination from Marcus)

**Inside the safe**:
- **The Ledger** (detailed records of all Vex's operations)
- 200 gold (Vex's emergency funds)
- Blackmail materials (letters, deeds, contracts used against victims)

**If party is caught**:
- Alarm raised
- **Combat Encounter**: 4 Vex Thugs (Level 2 Rogues) + Vex himself (if party lingers)

**If party succeeds stealthily**:
- They have the evidence
- Vex doesn't know YET (buys time)

**End Session 3** with the ledger obtained and Marcus freed. Party now has evidence, allies, and momentum. Time to confront Vex.

---

### Session 4: The Broker's Reckoning
**Level 3 - Final Confrontation & Boss Fight**

#### Opening: Vex Knows

**Morning after the heist**:

Vex learns his ledger is stolen. He responds by **taking hostages** (escalates to force confrontation).

**Town Square, noon**:

Vex stands on the steps of Town Hall with **6 thugs** holding **3 townspeople** (including Mira Copperkettle):

*"Someone has been VERY busy. Stealing from me. Turning my people against me. I admire the audacity—but I don't tolerate THEFT."*

*"Here's the deal: return my ledger, and these good people go free. Refuse, and... well. I'm sure you understand consequences."*

**Party's choice**:
1. **Return ledger** (lose evidence, Vex wins)
2. **Refuse** (hostages at risk, immediate combat)
3. **Negotiate** (Influence, Expert 4+ to stall for time)
4. **Surprise attack** (risky, hostages in danger)

**The Twist**:

If Marcus is redeemed, he arrives with **8 redeemed guards**:

*"Vex! Your hold on this town is OVER. Release them. NOW."*

Vex laughs: *"Captain. I'm disappointed. After all I did for your family. Seems gratitude is dead."*

---

#### Combat Encounter 2: Showdown at Town Square (Epic Boss Fight)

**Setup**:
- **Aldric Vex** (Level 5 Rogue Boss, Elite)
- **6 Vex Thugs** (Level 2 Rogues)
- **3 Hostages** (must be protected)
- **Allies**: Marcus + 8 guards (if redeemed) OR Father Torin + 4 temple guards (if Marcus not redeemed)

**Battlefield**:
- Town square, open ground
- Buildings provide cover
- Hostages are grouped center (must be freed)

**Aldric Vex (Level 5 Elite Rogue Boss)**:
- **HD**: 18d10
- **Proficiency**: 3
- **Attacks**:
  1. **Poisoned Dagger** (Light, Basic, 4d6, 2 HD + poison: Endurance save Moderate 3+ or -1d6 on next action)
  2. **Dirty Fighting** (Special, Moderate 3+): Trip, blind, or disarm target (opposed roll)
  3. **Call Reinforcements** (1/combat, Action): 1d6 more thugs arrive next round

- **Special Abilities**:
  - **Evasive**: +2d6 on defense rolls (slippery, hard to pin down)
  - **Exploit Weakness**: If Vex damages a target, his next attack against that target has advantage
  - **Not Alone**: While thugs are alive, Vex has advantage on attacks (pack tactics)

- **Tactics**: Stay mobile, focus on wounded PCs, use thugs as shields, fight DIRTY

**Vex Thugs** (Level 2 Rogues):
- **HD**: 6d8 each
- **Attacks**: Shortsword or Crossbow (Light, Basic, 2d6, 1 HD)
- **Behavior**: Protect Vex, threaten hostages if losing

**Victory Conditions**:
- Defeat Vex
- Rescue all hostages unharmed (bonus objective)
- Capture Vex alive (difficult—he'll try to flee if below 5 HD)

**Mid-Combat Redemption Moment**:

If Warlock uses **Voice of Platinum** on Vex:
- Vex confronts his choices: "I built an empire on fear. But what did it get me? Power? Wealth? I'm still alone."
- **Opposed Resolve check** (Expert, 4+)
- **If successful**: Vex surrenders, calling off his thugs: "Fine. You win. I'm tired anyway."
- **If failed**: Vex sneers: "Nice try. But I'm not one of your guilt-ridden guards. I LIKE what I do."

**If Vex is defeated**:

He collapses, bloodied:

*"You... you don't understand. This town NEEDED me. Without me, it was chaos. I brought ORDER."*

Party can:
- **Execute him** (immediate justice, but Bahamut disapproves—Mark of Redemption fades)
- **Capture him** (hand to regional authorities for trial—proper justice)
- **Offer redemption** (VERY difficult, but Warlock can try—Influence Expert 4+, opposed by Vex's broken Resolve. If successful, Vex accepts prison and begins reflecting on his crimes.)

**Aftermath**:

Hostages freed.  
Thugs surrender (those who survive).  
Town square erupts in cheers.  
Marcus arrests Vex officially: *"Aldric Vex, you're under arrest for extortion, blackmail, and corruption. You'll face trial."*

**End Session 4** with Vex defeated, hostages safe, and the town beginning to heal.

---

### Session 5: Restoration & New Beginnings
**Level 3 - Epilogue & Resolution**

#### Opening: A Week Later

The town is TRANSFORMED:
- Corrupt guards removed from duty (those who resisted redemption)
- Redeemed guards reinstated (Tyler, Kessa, others)
- Marcus reinstated as Captain (with oversight from council)
- Town markets are bustling without fear

**Regional Magistrate** arrives to oversee Vex's trial and restore proper governance.

---

#### Scene 1: Vex's Trial

**Town Hall, public trial**:

Vex stands accused. The ledger is evidence. Victims testify.

**The party can speak** (if they wish):
- Present evidence
- Testify to Vex's crimes
- Argue for punishment OR mercy

**Outcome**:
- Vex is convicted (undeniable evidence)
- Sentence: 20 years in regional prison OR exile (depending on party's recommendations)

**If Warlock advocated for mercy**:
- Vex, grudgingly: *"You're idiots. But... maybe there's something to this 'redemption' nonsense. I'll think about it. For twenty years."*

**If party was harsh**:
- Vex: *"Enjoy your victory. But empires built on fear never REALLY die. Someone will replace me."*

---

#### Scene 2: Honoring the Redeemed

**Captain Marcus** holds a ceremony honoring the guards who turned from corruption:

*"These people made mistakes. But they chose to FIX them. That takes more courage than never falling in the first place. I'm proud to serve with them."*

**Tyler**, now a full guard again: *"Thank you. You gave me a chance when I didn't deserve one. I won't waste it."*

**Kessa**: *"My mother is safe. I'm free. I can build again—not just walls, but a life. Thank you."*

---

#### Scene 3: Rewards & Recognition

**The Town Council** honors the party:

**Monetary Reward**:
- 100 gold per person (from recovered Vex funds)
- Free lodging in Silverbrook permanently
- Trade discounts (merchants remember who freed them)

**Items**:
- **Marcus's Gratitude**: Marcus gifts his old sword (masterwork longsword, +1d6 damage, inscribed "Redeemed")
- **Father Torin's Blessing**: Holy symbol of Valkora (grants +1d6 on Resolve saves, 1/day)
- **Kessa's Craft**: A masterwork shield (she made it herself, +1 to defense rolls)

**For the Warlock Specifically**:
- **Bahamut's Acknowledgment**: In a dream, Bahamut appears:
  - *"You did well, little one. You proved that mercy can break chains of fear. Not all were saved—but ENOUGH were. The Platinum Way is not about perfection. It's about TRYING. Carry this lesson forward."*
- **Permanent Upgrade**: **Redeeming Presence** becomes permanent (no longer tied to campaign—whenever you redeem an enemy, you heal)

---

#### Scene 4: The Path Forward

**Choices for the Future**:

1. **Stay in Silverbrook**: Captain Marcus offers: "We could use people like you. Stay. Help us rebuild."
2. **Move on**: The party has proven themselves. Other towns need heroes too.

**Hook for Next Adventure**:

A **merchant** approaches:

*"Word of your deeds spread. I represent interests in the capital. There's a situation—a corrupt noble house, exploiting workers. We need people who can CHANGE hearts, not just break heads. Interested?"*

**Party's choice**: Accept new mission, rest, or pursue other goals.

---

#### Scene 5: Epilogue

**One Month Later** (narrated):

*Silverbrook thrives. Markets are fair. Guards are trusted. Marcus walks with his head high, his daughter safe at his side.*

*Tyler and Kessa train new recruits—teaching them that honor matters more than orders.*

*Father Torin's temple is full on holy days. People have hope again.*

*And in taverns across the region, bards sing of the golden dragonborn who proved that even the fallen can be lifted up—if someone is willing to REACH for them.*

*The Platinum Paradox: That mercy, seemingly weak, can be the STRONGEST force of all.*

**End Campaign**.

- This campaign is SOCIAL-FIRST, combat-second
- Scale is intentionally small (one town, one crime boss, local corruption)
- Stakes are LOCAL, not world-ending (restore justice to a community)
- **Multiple NPCs can be redeemed or remain antagonists** based on player choices
- Warlock gets major spotlight, but all classes contribute
- Emphasize that mercy is DIFFICULT but REWARDING
- Allow failure—not everyone can be saved (Sergeant Blackwood, possibly Vex)

**Adjustments for Difficulty**:
- **Easier**: More guards are conflicted, Vex has fewer resources, Marcus easier to convince
- **Harder**: Fewer guards redeemable, Vex has contingencies, time pressure (Vex escalates faster)

## Moral Framework

This campaign explores: **Can good people who do bad things be redeemed?**

**The Answer**: SOMETIMES. With:
- Genuine remorse
- Concrete action to make amends
- Removal of coercive pressure (blackmail, threats)
- Support system to help them change

**But NOT ALWAYS**:
- Some people (Blackwood) enjoy corruption
- Some are too entrenched (Vex, maybe)
- Redemption requires CHOICE—it cannot be forced

**The Warlock PC embodies**: Aggressive optimism that refuses to give up on people, but learns when to apply justice instead of mercy.

## Conclusion

**The Platinum Paradox** is a LOW-LEVEL social campaign about local corruption, moral choices, and the power of mercy.

The stakes are personal: restore justice to Silverbrook, free Captain Marcus, show that  redemption is possible.

The Warlock gets absolute spotlight through Bahamut's blessing and redemption mechanics.

The party learns: changing hearts is harder than breaking bones—but infinitely more rewarding.

**"Mercy is not weakness. It is the courage to reach for the fallen, trusting they will rise."** — Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon
