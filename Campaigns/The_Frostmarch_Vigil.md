## The Northern Frontier

Three days' ride north of the last major settlement lies **Coldmarch**—a frontier logging town at the edge of civilization. Beyond it stretches the **Pale Forest**, a snow-shrouded woodland where temperatures rarely rise above freezing and the trees grow twisted and white from ice.

### Coldmarch

**Population**: ~200 souls
- Loggers: 80
- Farmers (hardy northern crops): 40
- Garrison (Winterwatch): 25
- Merchants, smiths, families: 55

**The Town**:
- Built around a central lodge (town hall, tavern, gathering space)
- Wooden palisade (12 feet, regularly maintained)
- Watchtower at north gate
- Modest temple to Valkora (Goddess of Valor)
- Lumber mill on frozen river
- Small market square

**The Economy**: Coldmarch supplies timber to southern cities. The Pale Forest provides a rare white-wood prized for shipbuilding. The town survives because of the lumber trade—and the **Winterwatch** that protects it.

### The Winterwatch

A small military garrison sworn to protect the frontier. Not a legendary order—just practical soldiers doing necessary work.

**Leadership**:
- **Captain Eryn Frostfeld** (Level 4 Combatant)
  - Veteran of 12 years on the frontier
  - Stern but fair, cares deeply for her troops
  - Missing her left ear (frostbite from a winter patrol gone wrong)

**Garrison Composition**:
- 15 guards (Level 1-2 Combatants/Rangers)
- 8 scouts (Level 1-2 Rangers)
- 2 sergeants (Level 3 Combatants)

**Philosophy**: 
The Watch isn't glamorous. They patrol logging roads, chase off bandits, rescue lost hunters, and deal with occasional wolves or ice bears. It's cold, dangerous work—but someone has to do it.

## The Problem: Something's Wrong in the Pale Forest

### Recent Events (Past 3 Weeks)

**Week 1**: 
- Logging crew #3 goes missing. Search party finds their camp abandoned—tools left behind, no bodies, strange symbols carved in trees.

**Week 2**: 
- Two scouts disappear on patrol. Their horses return riderless, covered in frost despite mild weather.
- Hunters report seeing blue-white lights moving through the forest at night.

**Week 3**: 
- A shepherd finds three of his sheep dead—frozen solid despite being near a fire.
- Old Burial Cairn north of town, normally quiet, now emits a faint blue glow at night.
- Last night: The north gate guard swears he saw a dead logger (from the missing crew) standing at the forest edge, just... watching.

**Current Situation**:
Captain Frostfeld has closed the lumber operations. The town's economy is stalling. People are scared. Patrols won't go more than a mile into the forest. Something is raising the dead—and it's getting closer to town.

---

## Campaign Hook: The Fighter's Connection

### The Winterwatch Recruitment

**[The Fighter PC]** has a personal connection to Coldmarch (player chooses):
- **Former Watch Member**: Served here for a year before leaving for adventure; Captain Frostfeld trained them
- **Family Ties**: Sibling/parent/cousin serves in the Winterwatch
- **Oath-Bound**: Swore an oath to defend the frontier settlements during their training

**Three days ago**, the Fighter received an urgent message via rider:

> *"[Fighter's Name], this is Captain Eryn Frostfeld, Winterwatch. The Pale Forest has turned against us. Dead loggers walking. Patrols vanishing. We're undermanned and out of our depth. I'm calling in every favor and oath I have. Come north. Bring capable allies. We need you. –Eryn"*

**For the Fighter specifically**, the message includes a **pewter badge** (the Winterwatch symbol: a torch crossed with a spear). Wearing it marks you as sworn to the Watch.

### The Offer

Frostfeld is blunt in her message:
- **Pay**: 50 gold per person (town's defense fund, not much but all they have)
- **Duration**: "Until the threat is ended or proven beyond our capabilities"
- **Risk**: "People are dying. You might too. But you're trained for this—we're not."

**What the town needs**: Investigate the source of the undead activity, eliminate the threat, and make the forest safe enough for logging to resume.

---

## Divine Boon: The Winterwatch Oath

Upon arrival at Coldmarch, Captain Frostfeld conducts a brief ceremony at Valkora's shrine. **Sister Maren** (Level 2 Priest, the town's only cleric) provides the blessing.

### The Oath Ceremony (10 minutes, requires dawn light)

Sister Maren anoints each PC with oil warmed by a candle:

*"Valkora watches those who stand in the cold places, who guard the edges of warmth against the darkness. You are not alone in your watch. The Goddess of the Last Stand sees your courage."*

Each PC receives a **small brand on their palm** (painless, glowing faintly)—the Winterwatch torch-and-spear.

### Blessing Granted: **Mark of the Winterwatch** (lasts through campaign)

**All Party Members**:
- **Cold Resistance**: Reduce natural cold damage by half (magical cold unaffected)
- **Deathwatch**: You can sense undead presence within 30 feet (doesn't give exact location, just direction and rough distance)
- **Watch Bonfire Rejuvenation**: When resting at a maintained campfire in the wilderness, regain +1d6 HD overnight

**The Fighter (Combatant) Specifically**:
- **Stand Fast**: 1/combat, when an ally within 10 feet would take damage, you can interpose yourself (you take the damage instead, but reduce it by 1d6)
- **Rally Call**: As a bonus action (no exertion cost), shout a command—all allies within 20 feet who can hear you gain +1d6 on their next attack OR defense roll (their choice). Usable 1/session.
- **Frostmarch Endurance**: Your HD pool increases by +2 while on this quest

**Sister Maren's words**: *"You bear the Watch now. Come back alive—and bring our people home if you can."*

---

## Story Progression

### Session 1: Into the Pale Forest
**Level 2 - Investigation & First Contact**

#### Scene 1: Arrival at Coldmarch

The party arrives at Coldmarch in the late afternoon. The town is tense:
- Gates are manned by nervous guards
- Few people in the streets (most inside before dark)
- Lumber mill is silent—no work being done
- Smoke from many chimneys (everyone staying warm indoors)

**Captain Frostfeld meets them at the gate**:

*"Thank the gods. I wasn't sure you'd come. [Fighter], it's good to see you again. And you brought allies—even better. Come inside. We'll talk in the Lodge."*

#### Scene 2: The Briefing

At the **Coldmarch Lodge**, Frostfeld lays out the situation:

*"Three weeks ago, Logging Crew #3 went missing—twelve people. We found their camp intact, but they were gone. Then scouts started disappearing. Then the lights started. Blue-white, moving through the forest. Last night, my gate guard saw Garrus—one of the missing loggers—standing at the tree line. Dead. Frozen. Just... watching."*

*"Something in the Pale Forest is killing people and raising them as undead. We don't know what or where. I've pulled everyone back to town until we figure this out."*

**She spreads a crude map on the table**:

**Key Locations**:
1. **Logging Camp #3** (5 miles north): Last known location of missing crew
2. **Old Burial Cairn** (7 miles northeast): Ancient stone monument, now glowing blue at night
3. **Scout's Last Position** (3 miles northwest): Where missing scouts were last reported
4. **The Pale Heart** (12 miles north, deep forest): Darkest part of the woods, rarely traveled

**Mission**: Investigate these sites, find the source of the undead, and eliminate it.

**Supplies Provided**:
- 7 days' rations (cold-weather provisions)
- 3 healing draughts (restore 1d6 HD each)
- Alchemical fire (4 vials, for burning undead or making emergency signals)
- Signal horn (if blown, Watch will send reinforcements—but takes 2 hours minimum)

**Frostfeld**: *"I'd send my best troops with you, but I need them here protecting the town. You're on your own once you enter the forest. But you're capable—that's why I called you."*

#### Scene 3: Journey to Scout's Last Position

The party departs at dawn. The Pale Forest is immediately oppressive:
- Trees are white-barked, twisted, covered in frost even on "warm" days
- Visibility: 40 feet due to dense trees and mist
- Sounds are muffled—unnatural silence
- Temperature: -10°F (cold but not lethal with proper gear)

**Travel Time**: 3-4 hours at careful pace

**Navigation (Moderate, 3+)**:
- **Skills**: Survival, Nature, Navigation
- **Failure**: Add +1 hour, trigger random encounter (wolves or minor undead)

**During Travel**:

**Perception (Basic, 2+)**: Notice tracks in snow:
- Boot prints (humanoid, stumbling gait)
- Drag marks (something being pulled)
- All tracks lead NORTH (toward deeper forest)

**Survival (Moderate, 3+)**: Identify tracks as "Frostbitten" (undead affected by extreme cold—not natural zombies, something specific to this region)

#### Scene 4: Scout's Last Position

The party finds a **small clearing** with:
- Two backpacks (scouts' gear)
- A cold campfire (abandoned 2+ weeks ago)
- Blood in snow (frozen, dark)
- Broken arrows scattered (signs of a fight)

**Investigation (Moderate, 3+)**:
- The scouts stood here and fought something—multiple attackers from north side
- They were dragged away (trail leads northeast toward Burial Cairn)
- One scout tried to escape (southbound tracks, but were caught)

**Perception (Expert, 4+)**:
- Carved into a tree: "NO WARMTH HERE. ONLY COLD FOREVER." (carved crudely, as if by frozen fingers)

**As the party investigates, ENCOUNTER**:

#### Combat Encounter 1: Frostbitten Scouts

The two missing scouts emerge from the trees—now undead, frost covering their bodies, eyes glowing pale blue.

**Setup**:
- **2 Frostbitten Scouts** (Level 2 Undead)
- Terrain: Forest clearing, scattered trees provide light cover
- Weather: Snow begins falling (light cover reduces visibility slightly)

**Frostbitten Scout (Level 2 Undead)**
- **HD**: 5d8
- **Proficiency**: 1
- **Speed**: 30 feet
- **Attack**: Frozen Shortsword (Light, Basic)
  - Rolls: 2d6
  - Required: 1 success
  - Base Damage: 1 HD
  - Special: On hit, target must succeed **Endurance Save (Basic, 2+)** or become *Chilled* (disadvantage on next attack roll)
- **Special**: **Frost Aura** — Creatures within 5 feet of a Frostbitten take 1 cold damage per round (automatic, minor attrition)
- **Vulnerability**: Fire damage deals +1d6
- **Behavior**: Fight with eerie coordination, try to surround targets

**Victory Condition**: Destroy both scouts

**After Combat**:

If the party searches the bodies:
- Scout Lyanna's journal (partially frozen, last entry readable):
  > *"Something at the Cairn. We heard singing—no, chanting. Followed the sound. Saw a figure in robes. Blue light everywhere. Couldn't move. So cold. Can't feel my..."*
- A **silver holy symbol** (Valkora's torch, worth 10g, can be returned to town)
- The scouts' weapons (masterwork shortswords, +1d6 damage, can be kept or returned)

**Burning the bodies takes 10 minutes and requires fire (alchemical vials or magic).**

#### Scene 5: The Burial Cairn

Following the tracks northeast, the party reaches the **Old Burial Cairn** (2 hours travel):

**The Cairn**:
- Ancient stone monument (20 feet tall, stacked stones)
- Covered in frost and ice
- Glowing with **blue-white light** (clearly magical/unnatural)
- Circle of frozen corpses around base (12 bodies—the missing loggers + scouts + others)

**Atmosphere**:
- The air is COLD here (even colder than surrounding forest—feels like -30°F within 50 feet)
- No sound—even wind is silent
- Faint chanting audible (no words, just tonal sounds)

**Perception (Moderate, 3+)**:
- The cairn's top stone has been REPLACED with a different one—dark blue crystal, carved with symbols
- The corpses around the cairn are arranged in a ritual pattern (points of a star)

**Arcana/Lore (Expert, 4+)**:
- This is a **Frost Focus**—a necromantic ritual device that channels cold energy to raise and sustain undead
- The blue crystal is the key—destroy it, and the undead lose their animating force
- Whoever placed it knows necromancy (not amateur work)

**As the party approaches within 30 feet, ENCOUNTER**:

#### Combat Encounter 2: The Frozen Dead

The 12 corpses around the cairn RISE simultaneously.

**Setup**:
- **10 Frostbitten Thralls** (mindless undead, loggers/scouts turned zombies)
- **1 Frostbitten Logger (Elite)** (Garrus, the crew foreman, partially aware)
- Terrain: Cairn in center (can be climbed, Athletics Moderate 3+), frozen ground (slippery)
- Objective: Destroy undead AND destroy the Frost Focus crystal

**Frostbitten Thrall (Level 2 Undead, Minion)**
- **HD**: 4d8 (weak)
- **Proficiency**: 1
- **Attack**: Frozen Claws (Light, Basic, 2d6, 1 HD damage, Chilling effect)
- **Behavior**: Mindless, swarm tactics, slow (20 ft speed)

**Frostbitten Logger (Elite, Level 2)**
- **HD**: 8d8
- **Proficiency**: 2
- **Attack**: Frozen Axe (Heavy, Basic, 3d6, 2 HD damage)
- **Special**: **Frost Breath** (1/combat, action, 15-foot cone, 2d6 cold damage, Reflex save Moderate 3+ for half)
- **Behavior**: Targets strongest-looking PC, fights with remnant logger skill

**The Frost Focus Crystal** (Object):
- **HP**: 15 (destroyed when reduced to 0)
- **Defense**: None (object)
- **Location**: Top of cairn (must climb to reach)
- **Effect**: While intact, Frostbitten within 100 feet regenerate 1 HD per round

**Tactics**:
- Thralls swarm party
- Elite Logger guards the cairn
- Party must either: destroy all undead THEN crystal, OR have someone climb and destroy crystal while others hold the line

**Victory Condition**: Destroy the Frost Focus crystal

**When crystal is destroyed**:
- It shatters with a sound like breaking ice
- Blue light fades
- All Frostbitten IMMEDIATELY collapse (no longer animated)
- The unnatural cold lifts slightly

**Aftermath**:

Searching the area reveals:
- A **leather-bound journal** hidden in the cairn's base (magical detection or thorough search, Expert 4+)
- Journal belongs to **Thane Coldbrook**, a name some locals might recognize (Lore/History, Moderate 3+): a hedge wizard who disappeared into the Pale Forest 10 years ago after being exiled from Coldmarch for "dark research"

**Journal excerpts** (relevant pages):
> *"They cast me out for seeking knowledge of preservation. Fools. They don't understand—cold preserves life. Cold SUSPENDS death. If I can master the frost, I can create servants who never tire, never hunger, never die."*

> *"The Pale Heart responds to my rituals. The deep forest remembers older magics. Three focus points—north cairn (complete), east grove (in progress), south hollow (planned). Once all three are active, I'll have enough power to expand the frost field to Coldmarch itself. They'll see. They'll BEG for the preservation I offer."*

> *"I am no necromancer. I am a savior. The cold is mercy. The cold is eternal."*

**Realization**: Thane Coldbrook is still alive (or undead) and creating MORE Frost Focuses. The cairn was just ONE of three planned sites. The party must stop him before he activates the others.

**End Session 1** with the party deciding: return to town to report, or push deeper into the forest to find Coldbrook before he completes his ritual?

---

### Session 2: The Eastern Grove
**Level 2-3 - Wilderness Travel & Ambush**

#### Opening: Decision Point

The party must choose:
1. **Return to Coldmarch** (report findings, rest, resupply) — takes 6 hours round trip
2. **Push forward** (track Coldbrook immediately, but risk exhaustion and combat without rest)

**If they return**: Captain Frostfeld thanks them, provides additional healing supplies, and urges them to finish the job. Town morale improves knowing one focus is destroyed.

**If they push forward**: They must manage resources carefully (HD attrition matters).

**Either way**, the next objective is clear: Find the **Eastern Grove** and destroy the second Frost Focus before it's completed.

#### Scene 1: Tracking Coldbrook

From the journal, the party knows the Eastern Grove is somewhere "3 hours northeast of the cairn, where the twisted oaks grow."

**Travel Challenge (6-8 hours through dense forest)**:

**Navigation (Expert, 4+)**:
- **Success**: Party finds the grove directly
- **Failure**: Party gets turned around, add +2 hours and trigger encounter (ice bears or wandering Frostbitten)

**During travel, random encounter (50% chance)**:

#### Optional Combat Encounter: Ice Bears

**2 Ice Bears** (Level 2 Beasts, territorial predators adapted to the cold):
- **HD**: 7d8 each
- **Attack**: Claws (Heavy, Basic, 3d6, 2 HD damage)
- **Special**: **Maul** (if both claw attacks hit same target in one turn, target is knocked prone)
- **Behavior**: Aggressive, but will flee if reduced below half HD

These are NOT undead—just natural predators made more aggressive by the unnatural cold.

#### Scene 2: The Eastern Grove

The party finds a clearing of **twisted oak trees**:
- Six massive oaks, leafless, covered in frost
- In the center: a stacked-stone altar (similar to cairn, but smaller)
- At the altar: **Thane Coldbrook**, a gaunt figure in frost-covered robes, chanting

**Thane Coldbrook** (Level 3 Necromancer):
- Tall, emaciated, skin pale blue with frost
- Eyes glow faint blue (partially transformed by his own magic)
- Obsessed, not entirely sane, believes he's "saving" people from mortality

**As party enters the grove**:

*"Ah. The Watch sends killers. I should have expected resistance from those who fear the gift I offer."*

**Social Encounter Option (Influence/Persuasion)**:

If the party engages Coldbrook in conversation:

**Influence (Expert, 4+)**:
- **Success**: Coldbrook hesitates, questions his own work—gain surprise in combat OR he surrenders peacefully
- **Failure**: He dismisses them as "ignorant fools" and attacks

**Arguments that resonate** (advantage on check):
- "You're killing innocent people, not saving them"
- "This isn't preservation—it's slavery to cold"
- "Would you want this for yourself?"

**Arguments that fail** (disadvantage):
- "You're evil" (he genuinely believes he's righteous)
- "The Watch will execute you" (he's accepted that outcome)

#### Combat Encounter 3: Thane Coldbrook & Frost Guardians

**If combat begins (or if social approach fails)**:

**Setup**:
- **Thane Coldbrook** (Level 3 Necromancer, Elite)
- **4 Frostbitten Thralls** (guards)
- **1 Frost Focus** (incomplete, on altar)
- Terrain: Grove clearing, oak trees provide cover, altar is central

**Thane Coldbrook (Level 3 Elite Necromancer)**:
- **HD**: 12d8
- **Proficiency**: 2
- **Speed**: 30 feet
- **Spells/Attacks**:

1. **Frost Bolt** (Ranged, Basic, 3d6, 2 HD cold damage, 60 feet)
2. **Raise Dead** (Action, Moderate 3+): Coldbrook reanimates 1d6 nearby corpses as Thralls (if corpses available)
3. **Frozen Armor** (Passive): First time Coldbrook takes damage each combat, ice absorbs it (negates up to 3 HD of damage)

- **Tactics**: Stay at range, use Thralls as shields, cast Frost Bolt at wounded targets, will flee if reduced below 4 HD

**Frostbitten Thralls**: Same stats as previous (4d8 HP, simple melee)

**Frost Focus (Incomplete)**: Can be destroyed (10 HP), but hasn't activated yet (destroying it prevents ritual completion)

**Victory Conditions**:
- Destroy Frost Focus
- Defeat or capture Coldbrook
- Destroy all Thralls (optional)

**If Coldbrook is reduced below 4 HD**:
He attempts to flee deeper into the forest: *"You don't understand! The cold is MERCY! I'll complete my work elsewhere!"*

**Chase Scene (Optional)**:
- Athletics (Moderate, 3+) to catch him
- If caught, he surrenders or can be killed
- If escapes, he flees to his hidden sanctum (The Pale Heart)

**Aftermath**:

If Coldbrook is captured alive:
- He can be interrogated (reveals location of his sanctum in The Pale Heart)
- He insists his work is "salvation, not damnation"
- Can be brought back to Coldmarch for Captain Frostfeld to deal with (trial/execution)

If Coldbrook is killed:
- His body begins to freeze over rapidly (his own magic consuming him)
- Party can search his robes: spell focus (blue crystal shard), ritual notes, map to his sanctum

**Destroyed Frost Focus #2**: Immediate effect—several Frostbitten in the area collapse (approximately 8-10 undead scattered in forest)

**End Session 2** with choice: Return to town with Coldbrook (if captured) OR press on to The Pale Heart to finish the job?

---

### Session 3: The Pale Heart
**Level 3 - Dungeon Crawl & Confrontation**

#### Opening: The Final Push

The party now knows the location of Coldbrook's sanctum: **The Pale Heart**, the deepest and coldest part of the forest.

**If Coldbrook is captured**: He can be brought to town (session begins with his trial/execution) OR taken along as prisoner/guide.

**If Coldbrook escaped or died**: Party follows map/notes to find sanctum.

**Travel to Pale Heart** (6-8 hours from grove):

This is the DEEPEST into wilderness the party has gone. Conditions worsen:
- Temperature drops to -20°F
- Visibility: 20 feet (heavy snow, dense trees)
- Wildlife: None (too cold, too dark)
- Atmosphere: Oppressive, feels like being watched

**Endurance Checks (Moderate, 3+)** required hourly:
- **Failure**: Suffer 1d6 HD cold damage (exhaustion setting in)
- **Mark of Winterwatch** helps (cold resistance applies)

#### Scene 1: The Frozen Sanctum

The Pale Heart is a natural hollow surrounded by ancient white trees. In the center: **Coldbrook's Sanctum**—half-buried stone ruin (old shrine or tomb, repurposed).

**Structure**:
- Single-level dungeon carved into frozen earth
- 4 rooms: Entrance, Workshop, Ritual Chamber, Living Quarters
- Lit by eerie blue-white light (magical cold-fire)
- Temperature INSIDE is colder than outside (-30°F)

**Entrance**: Stone door (ajar), covered in frost and necromantic symbols.

**If Coldbrook is with party as prisoner**: He can be forced to guide (Intimidation/Persuasion) or party can explore blind.

**If Coldbrook is NOT with party**: His **apprentice**, Mira Frostwhisper, is inside attempting to complete the ritual herself.

#### Scene 2: The Workshop

**Description**:
- Shelves of preserved specimens (animals, body parts, all frozen)
- Workbench covered in ritual components (blue crystals, necromantic tools)
- Notes and diagrams on walls (theories on "cold preservation magic")
- A **corpse on a table**, partially dissected (Coldbrook's experiments)

**Investigation (Moderate, 3+)**:
- Coldbrook was trying to create a "perfect" undead servant—intelligent, obedient, eternal
- His experiments mostly failed (resulting in the mindless Thralls)
- Recent notes mention "the source" — a natural wellspring of frost magic beneath the sanctum

**Arcana (Expert, 4+)**:
- The "wellspring" is likely a **Frost Ley Node**—a point where elemental cold energy pools naturally
- If corrupted with necromancy, it could create a permanent undead-spawning field
- Coldbrook's third Frost Focus is meant to TAP this node directly

#### Scene 3: The Living Quarters

**Description**:
- Simple bedroll (frozen solid, unused for weeks)
- Personal effects: journals, letters, a locket (painting of a woman and child—Coldbrook's family, dead from a winter plague 15 years ago)

**Reading the old letters/journals** (if party takes time):
- Coldbrook was a respected scholar in Coldmarch once
- His family died during a harsh winter epidemic
- He became obsessed with "defeating death through preservation"
- His research turned darker—exile followed
- He genuinely believes the undead state is preferable to death

**Humanizing moment**: Coldbrook is tragic, not purely evil. Misguided genius driven by grief.

#### Combat Encounter 4: The Ritual Chamber

**Description**:
- Large circular chamber carved into bedrock
- Floor is covered in frost-runes (glowing blue)
- Center: A **Frost Ley Node**—a swirling vortex of cold energy rising from a crack in the earth
- Positioned above node: **The third Frost Focus** (nearly complete)

**Present in chamber**:

**Option A (if Coldbrook is alive and escaped earlier)**:
- **Thane Coldbrook** (wounded, desperate, attempting to finish ritual)
- **6 Frostbitten Thralls** (his last defenders)

**Option B (if Coldbrook is dead/captured)**:
- **Mira Frostwhisper** (Level 2 Necromancer, Coldbrook's apprentice, attempting to continue his work)
- **8 Frostbitten Thralls**

**Option C (if Coldbrook surrendered peacefully)**:
- **Frost Elemental** (summoned accidentally when the Frost Focus activated prematurely)
- **4 Frostbitten Thralls**

**I'll detail Option A (most dramatic)**:

**Thane Coldbrook (Desperate, Wounded)**:
- **HD**: 6d8 (already injured from previous fight)
- **Proficiency**: 2
- **Enhanced by Ley Node**: Spells deal +1d6 damage while in this chamber
- **New Ability**: **Frost Nova** (1/combat, 20-foot radius burst, 3d6 cold damage, Reflex save Expert 4+ for half)

**6 Frostbitten Thralls**: Standard stats (4d8, basic attacks)

**The Frost Focus (Active, Final)**:
- **HP**: 20
- **Effect**: While active, generates **Frost Spawn** (1d6 new Thralls rise from the node every 3 rounds if corpses are present—which there are, around the chamber)
- **Must be destroyed to end fight**

**Environmental Hazard**:
- **Ley Node Exposure**: At the start of each round, all creatures in chamber take 1d6 cold damage (automatic, Frost Node's raw power)
- **Rune Circles**: Standing on specific runes grants advantage on cold-based attacks OR disadvantage on defense (PCs can choose positioning strategically)

**Coldbrook's Final Words** (when engaged):

*"You still don't understand! Death is the enemy! Cold is PRESERVATION! When I activate this focus, Coldmarch will be safe—EVERYONE will be safe—frozen, preserved, ETERNAL!"*

If party tries to reason with him (Influence, Expert 4+):
- **Success (very difficult)**: Coldbrook realizes he's become the monster he feared—he was trying to preserve life but only created death. He helps destroy the Focus himself, then collapses.
- **Failure**: He attacks, fully convinced of his righteousness.

**Victory Condition**:
- Destroy the third Frost Focus
- Defeat Coldbrook (kill or incapacitate)
- Survive the Ley Node exposure

**When Focus is destroyed**:
- The Ley Node's energy SURGES briefly (everyone takes 2d6 cold damage, one-time)
- Then the node SEALS (runes fade, chamber warms slightly)
- All Frostbitten in the entire region COLLAPSE (ritual network is broken)
- The Pale Forest begins a slow thaw (unnatural cold fades over days/weeks)

**Aftermath**:

**If Coldbrook lives**:
- He weeps, broken: *"What have I done? I only wanted them back... I only wanted to save them..."*
- Can be brought to Coldmarch for justice, or party can show mercy (let him leave the region)

**If Coldbrook dies**:
- His body freezes solid immediately, then shatters (consumed by his own magic)
- No resurrection possible (cold magic corrupted him completely)

**Loot from Sanctum**:
- **Coldbrook's Spellbook** (contains 3 frost-themed spells: Ice Bolt, Frozen Armor, Lesser Preservation)
- **Frost Crystal Shards** (x5, worth 20g each, can be used as spell components)
- **Masterwork Scholar's Robes** (+1 to Arcana checks, resist cold effect)
- **Coldbrook's Locket** (no monetary value, but poignant keepsake)

**End Session 3** with the party's choice: make camp and rest, or immediately return to Coldmarch to report success?

---

### Session 4: Aftermath & Complications
**Level 3 - Resolution & Loose Ends**

#### Opening: Return to Coldmarch

**If party returns immediately** (no rest): Travel takes 8-10 hours. Endurance checks required. Arrive exhausted but victorious.

**If party rests in sanctum/forest**: Recover HD, arrive at Coldmarch the next day.

**Upon arrival**:

The town FEELS different:
- Guards are more relaxed
- Loggers report: "The cold lifted this morning—we can work again!"
- People are cautiously optimistic

**Captain Frostfeld greets them**:

*"The forest... it's WARMING. Not much, but we can feel it. Whatever you did, it worked. Tell me everything."*

#### Scene 1: The Debriefing

Party explains:
- Found and destroyed three Frost Focuses
- Dealt with Thane Coldbrook (killed, captured, or redeemed)
- Broke the necromantic network animating the undead

**If Coldbrook is alive and brought back**:
- Town demands justice (execution)
- Captain Frostfeld allows party input: "You faced him. You earn a say. Execute him? Exile? Prison?"
- Moral choice: Punishment vs. mercy vs. redemption

**Frostfeld's reaction** (regardless of Coldbrook's fate):

*"You did what my entire Watch couldn't. The threat is ended. Logging can resume. People will stop disappearing. That's a debt Coldmarch can never fully repay—but we'll try."*

#### Scene 2: The Rewards

**Monetary Reward**: 
- 50 gold per person (promised pay)
- Bonus 30 gold per person (from grateful town council)
- Free lodging at the Lodge permanently (anytime you visit Coldmarch)

**Items**:
- **Winterwatch Cloak** (each PC receives one): Masterwork cold-weather gear, grants resistance to natural cold, +1 to Endurance checks in harsh weather
- **Frostfeld's Commendation** (written letter): Voucher that grants access to Winterwatch resources in any northern outpost (can call in future favors)

**For the Fighter Specifically**:
- **Winterwatch Captain's Badge** (steel badge with torch-and-spear symbol): Marks you as an honorary officer of the Watch
  - Grants authority to command Watch troops if needed
  - Provides access to armories and safe houses
  - Future plot hook: Can be called upon for other Watch missions

**Additional Rewards**:
- **Reputation**: Coldmarch remembers. NPCs treat party as heroes. Drinks are free. People want to hear stories.
- **Title**: "Defenders of the Frost" (informal, but recognized in northern settlements)

#### Scene 3: Complications (Optional)

**While celebrating at the Lodge that night**:

A **Winterwatch scout** arrives, breathless:

*"Captain! The southern border patrol sent word—Frostbitten were spotted near Greystone Village. Not many, maybe five or six. But... the closest Frost Focus was HERE. How are there still undead?"*

**Revelation**: 
The three Frost Focuses created MOST of the undead, but a few existed BEFORE Coldbrook's ritual. The Pale Forest has always had minor undead activity (natural result of extreme cold + old burial sites). Coldbrook amplified the problem, but didn't create it from nothing.

**Frostfeld**: *"Looks like the work's not completely done. But those stragglers are manageable—we can handle them now that the big threat's gone. Unless you want to help us mop up?"*

**This creates a choice**:
1. **Stay and help** with cleanup (mini-session, hunt remaining undead)
2. **Move on** (quest complete, let the Watch handle the rest)

**If party chooses to help**:

#### Combat Encounter 5 (Optional): Straggler Hunt

**Mission**: Clear out last undead near Greystone Village (4 hours south of Coldmarch).

**Setup**:
- Party joins a **Winterwatch patrol** (6 guards, Level 2)
- Find a small pack of **Frostbitten** (5 Thralls, 1 Elite) near an old roadside shrine

**Combat**:
- Straightforward fight with NPC backup
- Demonstrates how manageable the threat is NOW (compared to before)
- Victory is easy with party's power level

**Outcome**:
- Final remnants destroyed
- Greystone Village safe
- Watch confirms: "That's the last of them. Forest is clear."

**End Session 4** with closure: The Pale Forest is safe(r). Coldmarch thrives. The party has earned their rest—and the gratitude of the frontier.

### Session 5: Epilogue & New Beginnings
**Level 3 - Downtime & Future Hooks**

#### Opening: A Week Later

The party has remained in Coldmarch for approximately one week (rest, recovery, enjoying hero status).

**During this week**:
- Logging operations resume (economy stabilizes)
- Town holds a **Celebration Feast** in party's honor
- Sister Maren conducts a memorial service for the fallen loggers/scouts (respectful closure)
- Captain Frostfeld offers them **permanent positions** in the Winterwatch ("If you ever want steady work, the Watch is always hiring")

#### Scene 1: The Feast

**Coldmarch Lodge, evening**: 
- Entire town gathers
- Food and drink (hearty northern fare: roasted venison, potato stew, hot mulled cider)
- Music (local bard plays fiddle)
- Stories shared (NPCs recount the party's deeds, slightly exaggerated)

**Roleplaying Moments**:
- **Old Logger Tormund**: Thanks the party for avenging his son (one of the missing crew). Gives them a carved wooden token: "You're family now."
- **Young Guard Kess**: Asks the Fighter for combat advice (inspired by their heroism, wants to be like them)
- **Sister Maren**: Offers a blessing: "May Valkora watch your path. You've earned her favor."

**Frostfeld's Toast**:

*"To the Defenders of the Frost! They came when called. They stood when we couldn't. They held the line. The Winterwatch is stronger because of them—and Coldmarch is ALIVE because of them. To the Watch!"*

**Everyone raises drinks**: *"TO THE WATCH!"*

#### Scene 2: Personal Conversations

**During the feast, NPCs approach party members individually** (roleplaying opportunities):

**For the Fighter**:
- **Captain Frostfeld**, privately: *"You've done more for this town than I could have asked. The badge I gave you? It's not ceremonial. If you ever need the Watch, send word. We owe you. And if you ever want to come back and STAY... there's a sergeant position open. Just saying."*

**For other PCs** (adapt based on class/background):
- **Scholar/Mage**: Sister Maren gifts a book: *"Northern Spirits and Their Domains"* (lore on Pale Forest, future reference)
- **Ranger**: Scout Lysa (if alive) offers to teach a tracking technique (mechanical benefit: +1d6 on Survival checks in cold climates)
- **Priest**: Sister Maren discusses theology of Valkora and the nature of sacrifice vs. duty
- **Rogue**: A local merchant offers: "If you're headed south, I could use an escort. Bandits on the trade road. Pay's good."

#### Scene 3: The Call to Adventure

**The next morning**:

A **rider** arrives at the Lodge (dusty, exhausted from travel):

*"Message for the Defenders of the Frost. From Baron Kellard of Eastmarch. Urgent."*

**The sealed letter** reads:

> *"To the acclaimed adventurers of Coldmarch, word of your deeds has reached Eastmarch. We face a crisis—raiders from the Blackpeak Mountains attacking trade caravans. Local militia is overwhelmed. The Baron offers substantial reward for experienced warriors willing to aid. If interested, travel to Eastmarch (two weeks south). Ask for Commander Tyrell. –Signed, House Kellard"*

**This is a HOOK for the next adventure** (not part of this campaign, but sets up future play).

**Frostfeld**: *"Sounds like your skills are in demand. Can't say I'm surprised. If you go, watch your backs—Blackpeak raiders are no joke."*

**Party's choice**: Accept the job, decline and rest, or pursue other goals.

#### Scene 4: Departure

**If party decides to move on** (to Eastmarch or elsewhere):

**The town gathers at the gate to see them off**:
- Children wave
- Guards salute
- Frostfeld shakes each hand: *"You'll always have a home here. Come back alive."*
- Sister Maren: *"May the Goddess light your path."*

**As the party leaves Coldmarch behind**:

*The Pale Forest, once dark and menacing, looks different now. Sunlight filters through the white trees. Birds sing for the first time in weeks. The cold is still there—the north is always cold—but it no longer HUNGERS.*

*You've proven yourselves. Not as legendary heroes, but as capable defenders who answered the call when it mattered.*

*The frontier is a better place because you were here.*

*And somewhere ahead, new challenges await.*

**End Campaign**.

- **Coldbrook can be defeated, redeemed, or captured**—multiple resolution paths
- Combat is challenging but appropriate for low-level PCs

The Fighter gets spotlight through their connection to the Winterwatch and leadership opportunities.

The party learns: heroism isn't about saving the world—it's about standing for those who need you most.

**"Until the last dawn, we stand."**
