## Campaign Hook

**Tevenholme** is a fortified logging town on the edge of the vast **Spring Wood**—a primordial forest where ancient trees have stood since the First Sowing. For decades, Tevenholme prospered through careful, respectful logging guided by the **Elm Society**, a druidic circle that maintains balance between civilization's needs and nature's preservation.

**But two weeks ago, the Elm Society went silent.**

No druids emerged from their grove-sanctuary. No seasonal guidance was given. And without their blessing, the loggers fear cutting even a single tree will bring The Verdant Verge's wrath. The town's economy stalls. Tensions rise between desperate workers and those who respect old pacts.

**Then, five days ago, the trees began *moving*.**

Several loggers report entire groves shifting overnight. Ancient paths twist into mazes. And something massive prowls the deep woods at night—something that leaves claw marks twenty feet up tree trunks.

The **Tevenholme Council** (merchant lords and guild masters) hire the PCs to investigate the Elm Society's grove, discover what silenced the druids, and—if possible—restore the logging pacts before the town starves. But what they find will unearth an ancient betrayal, a broken oath, and a guardian who's been waiting centuries for justice.

## Story Progression

### Arc 1: The Silent Grove (Sessions 1-2)
**Level 1 - Into the Woods**

#### Session 1: Tevenholme & The First Clues

**Opening Scene**:
The PCs arrive in Tevenholme to find a town on edge. Lumber mills sit idle. Workers gather in taverns, arguing about whether to defy the druids and start cutting anyway. Armed guards patrol the forest's edge. A sense of desperation hangs in the air.

**Council Member Harlan Tevenwood** (Level 3 Sovereign, town magistrate) greets them at the **Council Hall**:
- *"Thank you for coming. We're not forest-folk—we're builders, traders. But we know enough to respect the Elm Society. They've guided us for generations. Now? Silence. And the woods are turning hostile. Find them. Bring back answers. We'll pay 300 silver markers and provide supplies."*

**Investigation Phase - Gathering Information**:

1. **Interview Factions** (Social Encounters):
   
   **The Loggers' Guild** (desperate, want to work):
   - Led by foreman **Garvash Ironbark** (gruff dwarf, Level 2 Combatant)
   - Claim: "The druids abandoned us. We should cut what we need and survive."
   - Clue: Show PCs a broken axe—snapped clean in half mid-swing three days ago, right before trees started moving
   
   **The Forest Wardens** (town guard, nervous):
   - Led by Captain **Libara Swiftbow** (elf ranger, Level 3 Ranger)
   - Claim: "Something ancient woke up. The forest feels *angry*. I've patrolled these woods for forty years—never felt this."
   - Clue: Three guards vanished on patrol last week near the Elm Grove; search parties found nothing
   
   **The Respectful**  (townsfolk who honor old ways):
   - Led by herbalist **Arathor Mosspetal** (elderly human, non-combatant)
   - Claim: "The Elm Society warned this might happen. There's an old story—The Concordant Warden. Bound by oath to protect the forest. They say we broke a pact."
   - Clue: Gives PCs a pressed flower from the Elm Grove as "safe passage token" (may help later)

2. **Examine the Forest Edge** (Investigation/Nature Check):
   
   - **Basic (2+) Nature Check**: Notice trees have shifted—paths that existed last week are gone, new clearings opened
   - **Advanced (3+) Tracking**: Find massive claw marks on trees, bark shredded 20-25 feet up (nothing natural climbs like that)
   - **Expert (4+) Perception**: Spot sigil carved into tree trunk—an ancient marking meaning "Oath Unkept"

3. **Investigate Missing Guards**:
   
   - Follow trail to where guards vanished (requires Ranger/Combatant tracking, Basic 2+)
   - Find: Torn cloaks, dropped weapons, signs of *rapid retreat* (not combat—they ran)
   - **Advanced (3+) Perception**: Notice footprints stop at a tree, as if they climbed... but trail ends 40 feet up in branches
   - **Secret**: Guards were scared off by illusions, fled into trees, got lost in shifting forest (still alive but wandering in circles)

**The Journey to Elm Grove**:

- 4-hour trek through Spring Wood
- Multiple skill challenges:
  - **Navigate Shifting Paths** (Ranger/Scholar, Advanced 3+): Forest actively *resists* travel; requires 3 cumulative successes to reach grove
  - Failure = encounter hostile wildlife or lose time (nightfall arrives early)
  
**Encounter: Forest Guardians**:

- **2-3 Thorn Stags** (elemental deer with antlers of living wood)
  - HD Pool: 4d6 each
  - Proficiency: 1
  - **Attack - Antler Gore** (Basic, 2+): 2 successes, 2 HD damage
  - **Charge**: If move 15+ feet before attack, add 1 HD damage
  - **Pack Tactics**: Flank and isolate targets
  - **Non-Lethal Option**: Can be calmed with Nature check (Expert 4+) + Arathor's flower token (lowers to Advanced 3+)

**Arrival at Elm Grove**:

The grove is a circular clearing where nine ancient elms form a natural amphitheater. At the center: a stone altar covered in moss. The druids' huts sit empty, doors open, belongings untouched. No signs of violence—just *absence*.

**Investigation Reveals**:
- Druids left mid-ritual (braziers still have ash, cups half-drunk)
- Altar has fresh carvings: "The Warden Rises. The Debt Comes Due. We Go to Answer."
- **Expert (4+) Scholar/Priest Check**: Recognize the carvings reference an ancient pact between Tevenholme's founders and a guardian spirit—a Combatant sworn to protect Spring Wood forever

**Session 1 Ends with Discovery**:
A hidden passage beneath the altar leads down into roots—to the **Undergrove**, where the Elm Society has been taken.

---

#### Session 2: The Undergrove & The Warden

**Dungeon Crawl: The Undergrove**:

A labyrinth of root-carved tunnels beneath the forest, lit by bioluminescent fungi. The druids were *summoned* here by the guardian—not captured, but called to witness judgment.

**Environmental Hazards**:
- **Shifting Roots**: Walls and floors move; requires Dexterity/Agility defense checks (Basic 2+) or take 1 HD crushing damage
- **Spore Clouds**: Sections filled with hallucinogenic spores; Resolve check (Advanced 3+) or suffer disadvantage on actions for 10 minutes
- **Darkness**: Only fungi provide light; ranged attacks beyond 20 feet have disadvantage

**Encounters**:

1. **Root Labyrinth (Skill Challenge)**:
   - Navigate maze (requires 4 cumulative Advanced 3+ successes using Perception/Survival)
   - Each failure adds 1 encounter with **Root Wraiths** (2d6 HD, spectral forest spirits)

2. **The Penitent Druids**:
   - Find Elm Society members kneeling in meditation chamber, bound by glowing root-chains (not painful, but unbreakable)
   - Led by **Elder Thornweaver** (Level 5 Shaman)
   - Explains: "The Warden summoned us. We are witnesses. Tevenholme must answer for the Broken Oath."
   - **Lore Dump**: 200 years ago, Tevenholme's founders made a pact with a warrior named **Harper Lustre**—she would bind her soul to the forest as eternal guardian, and in exchange, the town would never clear-cut, never burn, never desecrate. But 50 years ago, the Council authorized a *mass burn* to clear land quickly. The Warden felt the betrayal and has been gathering strength to enforce the oath.

3. **The Hall of Memories**:
   - Chamber with spectral visions playing out: Harper's oath-taking, the forest thriving, the burn... Harper's scream of betrayal
   - Resolve check (Advanced 3+) or lose 1 Resolve from emotional weight

4. **The Warden's Chamber (Boss)** :

At the deepest root, a massive chamber where an ancient oak throne sits. Seated upon it: **Harper Lustre, the Concordant Warden**—no longer human, but a wood-fused warrior, bark-armored and towering, eyes glowing with centuries of purpose.

**Harper Lustre, The Concordant Warden** (Level 6 Combatant, Oath-Bound Elite)
- HD Pool: 15d10 (Elite boss)
- Proficiency: 3
- Resolve: 5 (unshakable)
- Actions per turn: **5** (2 + party size for 3-player group)
- **Great-Sword of Roots** (Advanced, 3+): 3 successes, 3 HD damage, reach 10 feet
- **Oath-Breaking Strike** (Expert, 4+): 4 HD damage + target loses 1 Resolve (guilt manifestation)
- **Power Word: "Honor Binds!"** (Advanced, 3+): All oath-breakers in 15 yards make Resolve check or become *Restrained* (rooted in place) for 1 round
- **Summon Root Tendrils**: Environmental action (costs 1 action); tendrils erupt from ground, grappling 1d3 targets (Basic 2+ defense to avoid)
- **Regeneration**: Regains 2d10 HD at start of turn while in Undergrove (connected to forest)

**The Confrontation - NOT a Fight (Yet)**:

When PCs arrive, Harper doesn't attack. She *speaks*:

*"You bear the town's colors. Good. Witnesses. The druids have testified—Tevenholme broke the oath. The burn was sanctioned. I felt every tree scream. For fifty years I waited, gathering strength, hoping for repentance. None came. So now? I enforce the pact. At dawn, I march on Tevenholme. I will reclaim what was burned. The town will return to the forest."*

**Player Choice - The Heart of the Campaign**:

The PCs must decide how to handle this. Combat is *possible* but extremely difficult (she's a Level 6 elite in her own domain with regeneration). Options:

**Option A: Negotiate / Social Encounter**:
- Target Harper's Resolve (current: 5, very high)
- Requires multiple arguments/successes
- Possible Arguments:
  - **"The oath-breakers are dead"**: Most who authorized the burn are gone; punishing the current town is unjust (Advanced 3+, on success reduces Resolve by 1)
  - **"What would you have been?"**: Harper was human once; did she swear an oath to *protect* or to *punish*? (Expert 4+, reduces Resolve by 1, appeals to her humanity)
  - **"The druids honor you"**: Elder Thornweaver + druids can testify that current generation respects the forest (Advanced 3+, reduces Resolve by 1)
  - **"Let us make amends"**: Offer to broker NEW pact, hold oath-breakers' descendants accountable, restore burned land (Advanced 3+, reduces Resolve by 1)
- If Resolve reduced to 2 or lower: Harper hesitates, willing to listen to terms

**Option B: Combat (Desperate)**:
- Full boss fight
- Harper uses all abilities, summons **Root Elementals** (4d8 HD minions) mid-fight
- If PCs reduce her to half HD, she *stops*: "You fight with honor. I will hear your terms."
- Defeating her fully *kills* her (forest loses guardian permanently, Verdant Verge breaches weakened)

**Option C: Bargain / Quest Offer**:
- Propose a trial: PCs will bring oath-breakers' descendants to swear new pact AND restore burned land
- Harper sets three tasks (if she agrees to delay judgment):
  1. Make Council publicly admit the betrayal
  2. Replant the burned groves (symbolic act)
  3. Bind a new guardian to replace Harper (she's *tired* after 200 years)
- This extends campaign into Arc 3

**NPCs' Stance**:
- Elder Thornweaver supports negotiation (wants peace)
- Garvash (if somehow present) argues for combat (calls Harper un reasoning)
- Libara would negotiate (respects honor)

**Session 2 Ends**:
Harper agrees to a *three-day truce* to see if the town will honor a new pact. PCs must return to Tevenholme and convince the Council—or find another way.

---

### Arc 2: The Town's Reckoning (Sessions 3-4)
**Level 2 - Politics & Intrigue**

#### Session 3: Council's Divided

**Return Journey**:
- Harper releases druids + PCs
- PCs have 3 days to secure new pact or Harper marches
- Spring Wood remains hostile (shifting paths, guardian creatures)

**Tevenholme's Factions React**:

When PCs return with news, town *splits*:

1. **The Appeasers** (Arathor, some townsfolk, Elder Thornweaver):
   - Support admitting wrongdoing, making amends
   - "We broke an oath. Honor demands we answer."

2. **The Defiers** (Garvash, Loggers' Guild, some merchants):
   - Reject Harper's authority
   - "She's a monster. We owe her nothing. Let her come—we'll fight."

3. **The Pragmatists** (Harlan Tevenwood, Council majority):
   - Want compromise
   - "Admit fault publicly? The Council's reputation will suffer. But if it saves the town..."

**Social Encounters & Faction Manipulation**:

PCs must navigate council politics (no dice—pure roleplay with Resolve checks for key moments):

- **Convince Harlan to Publicly Admit Betrayal** (Opposed Resolve check, target 4):
  - Arguments: Honor, survival, legacy
  - Success: Harlan agrees; Failure: He offers private apology (insufficient for Harper)

- **Calm Garvash's Defiers** (Opposed Resolve, target 3):
  - Garvash wants to fight because he fears submission
  - Arguments: "Fighting is suicide," "Honor isn't weakness," "Your workers need the forest"
  - Success: Garvash stands down; Failure: He organizes militia (complication in Arc 3)

- **Rally the Appeasers** (Social encounter, 3 cumulative successes):
  - Organize public support for oath renewal
  - Hold town meeting, give speeches
  - Success: Majority of townsfolk support pact

**Skill Challenge: Restore the Burned Grove**:

Harper's second task requires symbolic repl anting. PCs + volunteers must:

1. **Gather Seedlings from Elm Grove** (requires druid cooperation, granted if Elder supports PCs)
2. **Cleanse the Burned Land** (Priest/Shaman ritual, Expert 4+, requires 3 cumulative successes)
3. **Plant & Bless** (all classes can contribute; teamwork-focused)

**Encounter: Sabotage**:

**Garvash's militia** (if PCs failed to calm him) attempts to sabotage replanting:
- **4 Militia Members** (Level 1 Combatants, 4d10 HD each)
- Non-lethal brawl (townsfolk fighting townsfolk)
- Goal: Subdue without killing
- Resolve check (Advanced 3+) to convince them to stop mid-fight

#### Session 4: The Binding Ritual

**Third Task: Bind a New Guardian**:

Harper's condition for retiring: Someone must take her place. The forest needs an Oath-Bound Warden.

**Candidates**:

1. **Captain Libara Swiftbow** (Ranger, willing):
   - Respects forest, experienced warrior
   - Binds willingly, becomes new guardian
   - Harper trains her before fading

2. **Elder Thornweaver** (Shaman, hesitant):
   - Powerful enough to bind
   - Fears losing humanity like Harper did
   - May require convincing (Resolve check)

3. **One of the PCs** (ultimate sacrifice):
   - If a PC volunteers, they become NPC guardian (character retirement/heroic ending)
   - Gains immense power but bound to forest forever
   - Player creates new character for future campaigns

4. **Collective Binding** (creative solution):
   - Entire Elm Society binds together as shared guardians (distributes burden)
   - Requires all druids + PCs to participate in ritual (Expert 4+ group check)
   - No single person sacrifices everything

**The Oath Renewal Ceremony**:

On third day, at dawn, ceremony at Elm Grove:
- Harper attends (towering, intimidating)
- Council must publicly admit betrayal (Harlan reads oath-breaking confession)
- New pact sworn: Sustainable logging only, burn prohibited, Elm Society has final say
- New guardian bound (chosen candidate performs ritual)

**Complication: The Burned Ones**:

As ceremony concludes, **ash-wraith spirits** emerge from burned land—echoes of trees killed in the burn:
- **The Burned Oak King** (mini-boss, Level 4 Elite)
  - HD Pool: 10d8
  - Proficiency: 2
  - **Charred Slam** (Advanced, 3+): 2 HD + inflicts "Ash Burn" (lose 1 HD per turn until cleansed)
  - **Summon Ash-Wraiths**: 3d4 minions (2d6 HD each)
  - **Rage**: Refuses peace; wants revenge for burning
  
**Harper Fights Alongside PCs** :
- She joins combat (uses her stats, GM-controlled ally)
- Protects town she once threatened
- Shows her true purpose: guardian, not destroyer

**Resolution**:
- Defeat Burned Oak King (he fades with whisper: "...remembered...")
- Harper kneels, exhausted: "This is why the forest needs a warden. Thank you."
- Ceremony completes peacefully
- New pact sealed

---

### Arc 3: The Aftermath (Sessions 5-6)
**Level 3 - Loose Ends & Future Threads**

#### Session 5: The Council's Dark Secret

**If PCs investigate deeper** (optional investigation sub-arc):

While researching the original burn, PCs discover:
- The burn wasn't just logging—something was *buried* beneath the burned grove
- Council documents reference "The Sealed Vault" and "Crown of Thorns"
- Whatever was buried is still there...

**Investigation Leads**:
- Old archives in Harlan's estate (requires breaking in or getting permission)
- Interview town elders who remember the burn (social encounters)
- Re-examine burned land (Perception/Scholar checks)

**Discovery**:
- 50 years ago, loggers unearthed an ancient ruin
- Inside: **The Crown of Thorns**, an artifact from the Age of Titans
- Council feared its power, ordered it sealed via burn (destroy evidence)
- But artifacts don't burn—Crown is still buried, dormant, slowly growing...

**The Crown of Thorns** (artifact alert system):
- Begin subtle corruption: plants near buried site grow twisted
- Foreshadows future campaign (Level 5+ arc)
- Not resolved in this campaign (plot hook)

#### Session 6: The False Warden

**Wild Card: Imposter Revealed**:

Just as peace settles, **a second "Harper"** appears at town gates:
- Claims SHE is the real Concordant Warden
- The one PCs met is an imposter/doppelganger/deceiver
- Town thrown into chaos again

**The Truth** (investigation reveals):

- This second Harper is real... sort of
- Harper Lustre was *twins*—Harper and **Laurel Lustre**
- Both swore the oath 200 years ago
- Harper became the Warden; Laurel was supposed to return to town as liaison
- Laurel vanished (presumed dead)
- But Laurel was taken by The Verdant Verge, transformed into fey-thing
- She's returned, jealous and twisted, wanting Harper's power

**Boss Fight: Laurel Lustre, The Verdant Imposter** (Level 5 Elite, Corrupted):
- HD Pool: 12d8
- Proficiency: 3
- Resolve: 2 (mad with jealousy)
- **Thorn Whip** (Advanced, 3+): 2 HD, 15-foot reach, pulls target 10 feet closer
- **Power Word: "I Am Warden!"** (Expert, 4+): Forces Harper (real) to make Resolve check or doubt herself (lose 1 action next turn)
- **Summon Verdant Aberrations**: 1d6 twisted fey creatures (3d6 HD each)
- **Tactics**: Tries to kill Harper (real) to take her place

**Climactic Alliance**:
- Harper (real) + New Guardian + PCs fight Laurel together
- Emotional fight (sisters turned enemies)
- Harper tries to reach Laurel mid-fight (Resolve checks)
- Laurel can be redeemed (Resolve reduced to 0 = surrenders, cries, apologizes) OR destroyed (HD to 0 = fades into spores)

**Resolution**:
- If Laurel redeemed: She joins new guardian as co-protector (sisters reunited)
- If Laurel destroyed: Harper mourns, vows to honor her memory

**Campaign Finale**:
- Tevenholme thrives under new pact
- Spring Wood Open s trails for respectful travelers
- Elm Society rebuilds
- PCs gain reputation as oath mediators
- Harlan offers them permanent positions as "Council Mediators"

**XP Award**: Party reaches Level 3

**Rewards**:
- **Magic Items**:
  - *Oathkeeper's Token* (medallion; +1d6 to Resolve checks vs. fear/doubt)
  - *Harper's Seed* (plant anywhere to summon forest ally once per week)
  - *Verdant Cloak* (advantage on Stealth in natural environments)
- **Path Board Unlocks**:
  - *Oath-Bound* node (Combatants gain Harper's blessing)
  - *Forest-Speaker* node (Rangers/Shamans gain Spring Wood connection)
- **Faction Rewards**:
  - Tevenholme: Permanent lodging, trade discounts
  - Elm Society: Druidic training, access to sacred groves

## Themes & Playtesting Goals

### Themes
1. **Oaths & Honor**: What does it mean to keep a promise across centuries?
2. **Justice vs. Mercy**: Is punishment for past sins fair if current generation is innocent?
3. **Sacrifice & Duty**: Harper gave up humanity; who else will sacrifice for peace?
4. **Nature & Civilization**: Can they coexist, or must one dominate?

### Playtesting Mechanics Tested
1. **Social/Resolve System**: Heavy emphasis on negotiation, opposed Resolve checks
2. **Faction Play**: Three-way faction dynamics (Appeasers/Defiers/Pragmatists)
3. **Oath Mechanics**: Combatant class features (Power Words, oath-bindings)
4. **Wilderness Survival**: Navigation, tracking, environmental hazards
5. **Elite Boss Combat**: Harper's multi-action turns, regeneration, environmental abilities
6. **Moral Choices**: Multiple solutions (combat/negotiation/sacrifice); no "correct" answer
7. **Group Skill Challenges**: Teamwork-focused tasks (replanting, ritual binding)
8. **Ranger/Shaman Spotlight**: Forest navigation, nature communion, druidic magic

### GM Notes for Playtesting
- **Flexibility**: Harper's stats can be adjusted; she's meant to be intimidating but not unbeatable
- **Social Emphasis**: 50% combat, 50% roleplay—test social mechanics thoroughly
- **Player Agency**: Multiple paths to resolution; reward creative solutions
- **NPC Depth**: NPCs should feel real—Garvash isn't "wrong," Harper isn't "evil"
- **Pacing**: Arc 1 = exploration/mystery, Arc 2 = politics/intrigue, Arc 3 = revelation/boss
- **Emotional Beats**: Laurel's twist (if used) should land emotionally—sisters separated by oath
