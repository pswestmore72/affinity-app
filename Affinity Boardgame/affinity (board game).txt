Cooperative Game:
* Uses dice and character sheets, and cards to advance through puzzles, and defeat foes. Added fun if players get into storytelling component, these are completely optional play augmentations.
   * Main storytelling abilities - Every character will have one move that costs a flat 1 of each resource to perform. That player is then free to create (in the scope, model, and form of their character), any ability or action that they see playable in the moment. The group will decide whether this action falls within the realm of reason for the character and scenario and decide whether to allow or not allow the action. Whether or not the group allows the action, the resources are spent and cannot be recovered, and this ability can only be triggered 3 times per game (fails count towards this). It is up to the player to make this ability believable, enjoyable and fitting to the story as a whole, and it is up to non casting players to scrutinize and keep the story on track in order to accomplish their goals and have the most fun.
   * Minor storytelling abilities - It is recommended (but optional), for players to embellish and flare to these moves that capture the essence of their character, team, and environment. These embellishments do not add to the outcome of the ability, but seek to add fun, depth, and ownership for the player. 
* Build resources to make character specific (or card based) actions, resources needed in specific combination relative to character archetype.
* Characters have two distinct styles specific to the character, either can be played
* At the start of the game there are a collection of possible augmentation cards, 1 will be chosen by each player. Once an augmentation card is chosen, its effects cannot be chosen by another player.
* Players will also choose the race(background?) of their character at the beginning of the game, each race has a minor strength and minor weakness


Players:
* 1 Character per game
* 1 Draw card per turn
* 2 Actions per turn
