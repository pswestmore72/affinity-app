# Affinity: Convergence
## Quick Start Guide

*Learn in 10 minutes. Adventure for hours.*

---

## The Goal

**Work together to complete the scenario objective.** Defeat enemies, solve puzzles, and tell a story.

You win together or lose together.

---

## Setup (5 Minutes)

1. **Pick a scenario** — Determines your objective and enemies
2. **Pick characters** — Each player takes one hero and chooses Style A or B
3. **Draw augmentations** — Reveal (players + 2) cards; draft one each
4. **Roll Health** — Roll as shown on your character sheet
5. **Draw 5 cards** — Each player draws from the Resource deck
6. **Start playing!**

---

## Your Turn

### Draw Phase

Draw **1 card** from any deck (Resource, Enhancement, or Action).

### Action Phase

Spend **2 Actions** on:

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Draw** | Draw up to 2 more cards |
| **Ability** | Use a character ability (pay resource cost) |
| **Trade** | Swap cards with a teammate |
| **Play Action Card** | Use an Action card from your hand |

### End Phase

- Max 12 Resource cards (shuffle excess back, draw 2)
- Max 2 Enhancement cards
- Max 2 Action cards

---

## Resources

Discard these to pay for abilities:

| Resource | Common Uses |
|----------|-------------|
| **Energy** | Everything uses this |
| **Mana** | Magic spells |
| **Agility** | Movement, finesse |
| **Will** | Mental effects |
| **Reagent** | Summoning, crafting |
| **Coin** | Buying, persuading |

---

## Using Abilities

1. **Choose ability** from your character sheet
2. **Pay the cost** (discard required resources)
3. **Spend 1 Action**
4. **Roll dice** (if damage)
5. **Describe it!** (optional but fun)

### Example

```
Nourish (Panpo)
Cost: 1 Energy, 1 Mana, 1 Reagent, 1 Will, 1 Action
Effect: Heal 2 + 1d6 damage
Enhanced: Heal 5 + 1d6 damage
```

Discard those 4 resource cards → Spend 1 Action → Roll 1d6 → Add 2 → Heal that much.

---

## Combat

### Attacking

1. Use an attack ability (pay resources)
2. Roll damage dice
3. Subtract from enemy Health
4. At 0 Health, enemy is defeated

### Getting Hit

- Enemies deal damage via Scenario/Enemy cards
- Subtract damage from your Health
- At 0 Health, you're **Incapacitated** (can't act, can be healed)
- If everyone is Incapacitated, **you lose**

---

## Status Effects

| Effect | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Quicken** | Extra action, unlock abilities |
| **Slow** | Lose 1 action, some abilities locked |
| **Poison** | Take damage each turn |
| **Confusion** | Skip your next turn |
| **Silence** | Can't cast magic |

---

## The Storytelling Rule

This is what makes Convergence special.

### Main Storytelling Ability

Every character can spend **1 of each resource** (Energy, Mana, Agility, Will, Reagent, Coin) to **invent any ability** that fits their character.

**Limits:**
- The group votes if it's reasonable
- 3 uses per game (failures count)
- Can't exceed your strongest normal ability

**Example:**
> *"I call upon the wind spirits to create a tornado that lifts us over the wall!"*
>
> *If the group agrees, it happens.*

### Minor Storytelling

Describe your normal abilities dramatically. No mechanical bonus—just more fun.

> *Instead of "I heal you for 4," try:*
> *"Golden light flows from my hands, knitting flesh and mending bone. Rise, friend—the battle isn't over."*
