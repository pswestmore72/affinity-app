# AFFINITY: CONVERGENCE — CHARACTER GUIDE

*Every soul drawn to the Focal Point carries their own answer to darkness. Finding harmony between them is the difference between legend and extinction.*

---

## UNDERSTANDING CHARACTERS

Each character in Convergence offers two distinct **Styles** representing different facets of their identity. Before the scenario begins, each player chooses which Style to embody—this choice shapes your role within the party and determines your available abilities.

### Character Anatomy

**Stats:**
- **Health:** Your Resolve Track length. Reaching 0 eliminates you from the scenario.
- **Attack:** Base damage dealt when performing attack actions.
- **Defense:** Damage reduction against incoming attacks.
- **Speed:** Movement points per turn and initiative order.

**Items:**
Each character starts with 2 Items representing their signature equipment. Items provide passive bonuses or limited-use abilities.

**Abilities:**
Each Style grants 4 unique abilities with varying resource costs. Abilities define your tactical options and synergies with other players.

**Unique Trait:**
A passive effect that distinguishes you regardless of Style choice.

## THE SIX CONVERGENCE HEROES

---

## 1. PANPO — THE ELEMENTALIST

*"The Weave didn't teach me magic. It taught me to listen."*

**Origin:** Born where the Verge meets mortal lands, Panpo perceives the boundary between planes as porous rather than fixed. Where others see fire, they see a conversation. Where others fear the storm, they hear its invitation.

**Role in the Party:** Primary damage dealer with area effects. Panpo excels at clearing clusters of enemies but requires resource management to avoid burnout.

---

### STYLE A: ARCANE CONDUIT

*Channel raw elemental energy directly from the Sovereign Realms.*

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Health | 8 |
| Attack | 3 |
| Defense | 1 |
| Speed | 3 |

**Starting Items:**
- **Weavetouched Staff** — +1 to all spell damage
- **Ember Flask** — Discard: Deal 2 damage to all enemies in target space

**Abilities:**

| Ability | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Elemental Burst** | 2 Fire | Deal 4 damage to target enemy and 2 damage to all enemies adjacent to it |
| **Flame Ward** | 1 Fire | Until your next turn, the next enemy that attacks you takes 3 damage |
| **Inferno Walk** | 2 Fire, 1 Wild | Move up to 4 spaces. Deal 2 damage to each enemy you move through |
| **Conflagration** | 3 Fire, 1 Wild | **Storytelling Ability.** Deal 3 damage to ALL enemies on the map. Describe how the flames find each one |

**Unique Trait — Planar Echo:** When you spend Fire resources, you may treat one Wild as Fire.

**Playstyle Notes:**
Arcane Conduit Panpo wants to position near enemy clusters and unleash devastating area attacks. Fire resources fuel everything—coordinate with teammates who can feed you Wild cards when the situation demands Conflagration.

---

### STYLE B: GREEN SYNTHESIS

*Draw power from living things—and return it tenfold.*

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Health | 10 |
| Attack | 2 |
| Defense | 2 |
| Speed | 2 |

**Starting Items:**

- **Seedling Pouch** — Discard: Create difficult terrain in target space

**Abilities:**

| Ability | Cost | Effect |

| **Worldsong** | 3 Green, 2 Wild | **Storytelling Ability.** All allies heal 3 Health. All enemies take 2 damage. Describe the harmony of growth and decay |

**Unique Trait — Planar Echo:** When you spend Green resources, any excess healing becomes temporary Health (max 3).

**Playstyle Notes:**
Green Synthesis transforms Panpo into a battlefield controller and secondary healer. Use Thornwall to funnel enemies into kill zones while Life Bloom keeps the frontline fighting.

---

## 2. EEGAN & ABBO — THE UNLIKELY DUO

*"I write the songs. He springs the traps. Between us, we've never lost an audience."*

**Origin:** Eegan was a traveling bard whose wagon wheel broke in the Thornwood. Abbo was a goblin trap-maker whose traps kept catching Eegan's mule. Rather than continue their escalating war, they struck an accord: Eegan's stories would distract marks while Abbo "collected tolls." They've been inseparable since—partners in crime turned partners in heroism when the Focal Point's pull proved stronger than their wanderlust.

**Role in the Party:** Controller and utility. Eegan & Abbo excel at manipulating enemy movement, enabling devastating combos for damage-focused allies.

---

### STYLE A: TRAPMASTER

*The battlefield is a puzzle. Every solution involves something clicking shut.*

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|

**Unique Trait — Perfect Timing:** When an enemy triggers one of your traps, you may immediately move 2 spaces.

**Playstyle Notes:**
Trapmaster Eegan & Abbo requires planning turns in advance. Place traps before enemies arrive, then use Pressure Plate to chain reactions when the moment is perfect. Your high Speed lets you reposition constantly.

---

### STYLE B: SPELL BARD

*Every legend begins with a song. Every enemy deserves a verse.*

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Health | 8 |
| Attack | 2 |
| Defense | 1 |
| Speed | 3 |

**Starting Items:**

**Playstyle Notes:**
Spell Bard empowers the entire team. Position centrally to maximize Rally Chorus range, and save Epic of the Convergence for moments when bonus actions will turn the tide.

---

## 3. GARRETTH — THE BULWARK

*"Stand behind me. I'll explain why later."*

**Origin:** Once a knight-commander of the Empyreal Accord's mortal auxiliaries, Garretth's regiment was shattered defending a village from a Fractured Realm incursion. He alone survived—not through skill, but because something in the Weave recognized his willingness to die for strangers. Now he carries that village's memory as a shield, and that regiment's honor as a sword.

**Role in the Party:** Primary defender. Garretth absorbs punishment meant for allies and holds chokepoints against overwhelming numbers.

---

### STYLE A: SHIELD WALL

*No enemy passes. No ally falls. This is the oath.*

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|

| **The Unbroken Wall** | 3 Steel, 2 Wild | **Storytelling Ability.** Become immune to damage until end of round. All damage that would have hit you is described as failing against your resolve |

**Unique Trait — Iron Devotion:** When an adjacent ally would take damage, you may take 2 of that damage instead.

**Playstyle Notes:**
Shield Wall Garretth wants to stand in chokepoints with allies behind him. Use Guardian's Challenge to force dangerous enemies to waste attacks on your superior Defense.

---

### STYLE B: BATTLE WRATH

*When defense fails, overwhelming force remains.*

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Health | 10 |
| Attack | 4 |
| Defense | 2 |
| Speed | 3 |

**Starting Items:**

**Unique Trait — Iron Devotion:** When an ally is defeated, gain +2 Attack for the remainder of the scenario.

**Playstyle Notes:**
Battle Wrath trades protection for devastation. You're most dangerous when wounded—consider not healing to maintain damage bonuses.

---

## 4. LIBESTRA — THE SERENIST

*"Pain is information. Let me translate."*

**Origin:** A healer trained in the temples where the Gloam's edge touches mortal lands, Libestra understands that death and life are not opposites but partners in an eternal dance. She learned to speak both languages—to call the dying back from the threshold, and to help the living understand their pain.

**Role in the Party:** Primary healer and buffer. Libestra keeps allies fighting and can neutralize enemy advantages through debuffs.

---

### STYLE A: LIFE WEAVER

**Unique Trait — Empathic Bond:** When you heal an ally, you may choose to heal them an additional 1 Health and take 1 damage yourself.

**Playstyle Notes:**
Life Weaver Libestra should stay near wounded allies but out of direct combat. Save Miraculous Recovery for clutch moments—it can turn certain defeat into dramatic victory.

---

### STYLE B: THOUGHT BINDER

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|

**Playstyle Notes:**
Thought Binder turns enemies against themselves. Mental Lock removes dangerous abilities from play while Puppet Strings and Shattered Will create chaos in enemy ranks.

---

## 5. DA'AVID — THE WARDEN

*"The forest remembers what cities forget. So do we."*

**Origin:** Rangers who serve at the edges of civilization, where the Verge's influence makes the wild strange and hungry. Da'Avid bonded with his companion—a spectral wolf named Shade—during a three-day storm where reality grew thin. Together they hunt things that shouldn't exist, and protect people who'll never know the danger they escaped.

**Role in the Party:** Versatile striker with reconnaissance utility. Da'Avid can operate away from the group and still contribute meaningfully.

---

### STYLE A: FAR HUNTER

**Playstyle Notes:**
Beast Kin treats you and Shade as a combined combat unit. Coordinate to flank enemies for maximum effect, but remember that losing Shade now hurts you directly.

---

## 6. TAPREK — THE SHADOW

*"You saw me because I allowed it. Be grateful."*

**Origin:** Born in the Gloam's edge-cities where night lasts longer than day, Taprek learned that survival meant being seen only when you chose to be. He doesn't kill for pleasure or profit—he kills because some monsters wear human faces of power and need removing before they harm the vulnerable. The Focal Point's pull offers him targets truly worthy of his art.

**Role in the Party:** Burst damage assassin. Taprek eliminates priority targets before they can threaten the party.

---

---

## PARTY COMPOSITION

### Recommended Combinations

**The Classic Party (4 players):**
- Garretth (Shield Wall) — Hold the line
- Panpo (Arcane Conduit) — Damage
- Libestra (Life Weaver) — Healing
- Da'Avid (Far Hunter) — Versatility

**The Control Party (4 players):**
- Eegan & Abbo (Trapmaster) — Area denial
- Libestra (Thought Binder) — Enemy control
- Taprek (Darkness Walker) — Assassination
- Panpo (Green Synthesis) — Healing and walls

**The Aggressive Party (4 players):**
- Garretth (Battle Wrath) — Frontline damage
- Taprek (Vital Striker) — Priority kills
- Da'Avid (Beast Kin) — Multiple attacks
- Eegan & Abbo (Spell Bard) — Attack buffs

### Style Synergies

| If Running... | Consider Pairing With... |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| No healer Style | Panpo (Green Synthesis) or Items with healing |
| Two melee fighters | Eegan & Abbo (Trapmaster) to control approach |
| Two ranged fighters | Garretth (Shield Wall) to protect positions |
| High damage, low defense | Libestra (Life Weaver) for sustain |
| Multiple debuffers | Taprek (Vital Striker) to capitalize |

---

## ADVANCED TACTICS

### Resource Sharing

The Resource Row is communal. Consider:
- Announcing before taking if teammates might need specific resources
- "Farming" Wild resources for teammates' Storytelling abilities
- Leaving Fire/Green for Panpo, Shadow for Taprek, etc.

### Positioning

- **Garretth** should be between enemies and allies
- **Libestra** should be one space behind the front line
- **Da'Avid** should be 3-4 spaces from combat, elevated if possible
- **Taprek** should flank or approach from unexpected angles
- **Panpo** should be near clusters but not in melee
- **Eegan & Abbo** should prepare spaces enemies will enter

### When to Use Storytelling Abilities

Storytelling abilities are powerful but expensive. Save them for:
- **Mini-boss encounters** where their impact justifies the cost
- **Scenario pivots** when the tide needs turning
- **Character moments** when the narrative calls for heroism
- **Emergency situations** like Miraculous Recovery

*"Six souls. Six answers. One purpose. The Convergence chose well."*
