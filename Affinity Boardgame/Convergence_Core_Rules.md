# Affinity: Convergence
## Core Rules for Cooperative Adventure

*Heroes gather. Fates converge. Stories unfold.*

---

## Introduction

**Affinity: Convergence** is a cooperative board game for 2-6 players set in the fractured cosmology of Aeralon. Players take on the roles of legendary heroes, working together to overcome scenarios filled with puzzles, enemies, and narrative choices.

What makes Convergence unique is its **storytelling integration**—players are encouraged to embellish their actions, create dramatic moments, and even invent abilities on the fly. The rules provide structure; the players provide the story.

---

## Setup

### 1. Choose Scenario

Select a scenario card. This determines:
- Main objective
- Map layout
- Enemy composition
- Special rules

**Scenario Length:**
- **Fast** (30-45 min): Fewer mini-boss cards, fewer quest cards
- **Medium** (45-75 min): Standard composition
- **Long** (75-120 min): Full enemy deck, multiple objectives

### 2. Choose Characters

Each player selects one hero and takes their character sheet. Heroes have **two distinct play styles**—choose one:

| Hero | Style A | Style B |
|------|---------|---------|
| Panpo | Elementalist (Support/Caster) | The Green (Summoner/Support) |
| Eegan & Abbo | Trapper/Rogue (Offense) | Spell Bard (Support) |
| Garretth | Maker (Support) | Arsenal (Offense) |
| Libestra | Sorceress (Offense/Damage) | Dark Mage (Control) |
| Da'Avid | Sage (Support) | Archmage (Powerhouse) |
| Taprek | Adventurer (Leader) | Illusionist (Control) |

### 3. Choose Race/Background

Each player chooses a race for their character. Races provide:
- One minor strength
- One minor weakness

*(See Race Guide for options)*

### 4. Choose Augmentation

Reveal augmentation cards equal to the number of players plus two. Each player drafts one augmentation. **Once chosen, that augmentation is unavailable to other players.**

### 5. Build Decks

Shuffle the following decks:
- **Resource Deck:** All resource cards combined
- **Enhancement Deck:** All enhancement cards
- **Action Deck:** All action cards
- **Scenario Deck:** As specified by the scenario

### 6. Draw Starting Hands

Each player draws **5 cards** from the Resource deck.

### 7. Set Health

Roll for starting Health as specified on your character sheet (typically 10 + 1d6).

---

## Turn Structure

Players take turns in any agreed order. On your turn:

### 1. Draw Phase

Draw **1 card** from any deck (Resource, Enhancement, or Action).

### 2. Action Phase

You have **2 Actions** to spend. Possible actions:

| Action | Cost | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Draw** | 1 Action | Draw up to 2 cards (cannot be 2 Enhancement or 2 Action) |
| **Attack/Ability** | 1 Action | Use a character ability (pay resource cost) |
| **Trade** | 1 Action | Trade up to 2 Resource cards OR 1 Enhancement card with a teammate |
| **Use Action Card** | 1 Action | Play an Action card from your hand |

### 3. Discard Phase (if needed)

**The Rule of 7:**
- Maximum **12 Resource cards** in hand at end of turn
- If you exceed 12, shuffle excess into the Resource deck and draw 2 new cards
- Maximum **2 Enhancement cards** in hand at any time
- Maximum **2 Action cards** in hand at any time

---

## Resources

Six types of resources fuel your abilities:

| Resource | Used For |
|----------|----------|
| **Energy** | Basic resource, used by all characters |
| **Mana** | Spellcasting, magical effects |
| **Agility** | Movement, dodging, physical finesse |
| **Will** | Mental effects, buffs, debuffs |
| **Reagent** | Crafting, summoning, alchemy |
| **Coin** | Purchasing, persuasion, NPC interaction |

### Resource Costs

Each ability lists its resource cost. You must discard the required resources from your hand to use the ability.

**Example:**
```
Elemental Imbue
Cost: 1 Energy, 1 Will, 1 Reagent, 1 Action
```

To use this, discard 1 Energy card, 1 Will card, and 1 Reagent card, then spend 1 Action.

---

## Card Types

### Resource Cards

Basic resources discarded to pay ability costs. Collected from the Resource deck.

### Enhancement Cards

Modify your abilities or Action cards. Effects are detailed on each card.
- **Hand Limit:** 2 at end of turn
- **Usage:** Attached to an ability when used (discard after)
- Some abilities have "Enhanced" effects when played with an Enhancement

### Action Cards

Non-character-specific actions playable on **any player's turn** (including enemies').
- **Hand Limit:** 2 at any time
- **Usage:** Play and resolve immediately
- Examples: Interrupt attacks, provide emergency healing, reveal hidden information

---

## Combat

### Attacking Enemies

1. **Declare ability** and pay resource cost
2. **Roll damage** as specified (typically 1d6 or 0.5×1d6)
3. **Apply damage** to enemy Health
4. **Resolve enemy reaction** (if any)

### Enemy Turns

Enemies act via the **Scenario Deck** or can be controlled by a designated player (Enemy Controller variant).

**Automated Enemy Turns:**
1. Flip the top card of the Scenario/Enemy deck
2. Resolve the card's instructions
3. Enemy abilities may: deal damage, force resource discard, apply debuffs, summon reinforcements

### Damage to Heroes

When a hero takes damage:
1. Reduce Health by the damage amount
2. Mark new Health on character sheet
3. At **0 Health**, the hero is **Incapacitated**

**Incapacitated Heroes:**
- Cannot take actions
- Can be revived by healing abilities
- If all heroes are Incapacitated, the party loses

---

## Status Effects

Track status effects with tokens on character sheets.

### Buffs

| Status | Effect | Duration |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Quicken** | Gain 1 additional Minor Action; some abilities require Quicken | Until removed |
| **Shield** | Absorb X damage before Health is affected | Until depleted |
| **Inspired** | +1 to all damage rolls | 1 turn |

### Debuffs

| Status | Effect | Duration |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Confusion** | Skip next turn | 1 turn |
| **Slow** | Lose 1 Action; some abilities unavailable while Slowed | Until removed |
| **Poison** | Take damage at start of turn | As specified |
| **Silence** | Cannot cast magical abilities | Until removed |

### Immunity and Resistance

- Some creatures build **immunity** to repeated status effects
- Bosses may be **fully immune** to certain effects
- Character traits may grant permanent immunities

---

## Storytelling System

What makes Convergence special is its narrative flexibility.

### Main Storytelling Ability

Every character has **one Main Storytelling Ability** that costs a flat **1 of each resource** (1 Energy, 1 Mana, 1 Agility, 1 Will, 1 Reagent, 1 Coin).

**When activated:**
1. The player describes **any action** within the scope of their character
2. The group votes on whether the action is:
   - Within character scope
   - Reasonable for the scenario
   - Fitting for the story
3. **If approved:** The action succeeds as described
4. **If rejected:** The resources are still spent, the action fails, it still counts as one of your 3 uses

**Limits:**
- Usable only **3 times per game** (failures count)
- Damage/buffs cannot exceed the character's strongest basic ability
- Effects last maximum 1 turn

**Example:**
> *Panpo's player activates "Beckon the Elements": "I call upon the earth spirits to form a stone bridge across the chasm, allowing the party to cross safely."*
>
> *The group agrees this fits Panpo's elemental theme and the bridge forms.*

### Minor Storytelling Abilities

Many character abilities are marked as "Minor Storytelling Abilities." These work normally but players are **encouraged to describe them creatively**.

**No mechanical benefit**—but adds fun, depth, and ownership.

**Example:**
> *Instead of saying "I use Elemental Imbue on Eegan," Panpo's player might say:*
>
> *"Panpo reaches toward the nearby torch, drawing threads of flame through the air. He weaves them around Eegan's daggers until they glow with inner fire. 'Strike true,' he whispers."*

## Character Stats

Each character has five stats, rolled at game start:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Health** | Hit points; 0 = Incapacitated |
| **Charisma** | Social interactions, persuasion, NPC reactions |
| **Knowledge** | Puzzle-solving, lore, identifying objects |
| **Power** | Magical and physical damage potential |
| **Will** | Mental fortitude, resisting control effects |

### Rolling Stats

At game start, roll for each stat as specified on your character sheet (typically base + 1d6).

### Stat Checks

When a scenario requires a stat check:
1. GM (or scenario card) declares the difficulty (target number)
2. Player rolls 1d6 + relevant stat modifier
3. Meet or exceed the target = success

---

## Familiars and Companions

Some characters have **Familiars**—companion creatures that can take independent actions.

### Familiar Rules

- Familiars have their own Health pool
- **Shared Actions:** Some character/familiar pairs share the 2 Actions per turn
- **Separate Actions:** Some pairs each get their own actions
- Familiars can be dismissed and re-summoned (costs vary by character)
- If a Familiar is destroyed, it can typically be re-summoned (costs vary)

### Example Familiars

| Familiar | Master | Type |
|----------|--------|------|
| Abbo | Eegan | Feline Rogue |
| Creeper | Panpo (Green) | Plant Fiend |
| Shroom King | Panpo (Green) | Fungal Controller |
| Meadow Ward | Panpo (Green) | Healer Spirit |

---

## Scenarios

### Scenario Cards

Each scenario includes:
- **Main Scenario Card:** Primary objective, setting, special rules
- **Quest Cards:** Optional side objectives
- **Directive Cards:** Story beats and decision points
- **Enemy Cards:** Creature stats and behaviors
- **Mini-Boss Cards:** Powerful enemies with special abilities

### Scenario Setup by Length

| Length | Mini-Boss | Quest | Directive | Enemy Action |
|--------|-----------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Fast | 1 | 1 | 2 | 5 |
| Medium | 2 | 2 | 4 | 8 |
| Long | 3 | 4 | 6 | 12 |

### Enemy Controller Variant

Instead of automated enemy turns, one player (or a non-playing GM) controls all enemies. This adds:
- Strategic enemy movement
- Reactive enemy tactics
- More engaging combat
- Can swap controllers each scenario

---

## Winning and Losing

### Victory

Complete the scenario's main objective. This might be:
- Defeat the final boss
- Solve the puzzle before time runs out
- Rescue the prisoners
- Escape the collapsing dungeon

### Defeat

The party loses if:
- All heroes are Incapacitated simultaneously
- Scenario-specific loss condition is met
- Party fails a critical objective

### Partial Victory

Some scenarios have tiered outcomes:
- **Full Victory:** All objectives complete
- **Partial Victory:** Main objective complete, side objectives failed
- **Heroic Sacrifice:** One hero gave their life; others succeeded

---

## Advanced Rules

### Trading

- **1 Action** = Trade up to 2 Resource cards OR 1 Enhancement card
- Trade only happens between two willing teammates
- Cannot trade Action cards
- Both players must agree on the trade

### Purchasing

When a scenario includes merchants or shops:
- Pay **4 Coin** + 1 Action to purchase an item
- Available items specified by scenario
- Some items are single-use; others are permanent

### The Rule of 12

If you end your turn with more than 12 Resource cards:
1. Shuffle all excess cards into the Resource deck
2. Draw 2 new Resource cards
3. This is meant to **encourage trading**, not hoarding

## Tips for First Time Players

1. **Trade resources frequently** — No one character has everything they need
2. **Coordinate abilities** — Stack buffs before big attacks
3. **Use storytelling abilities early** — Don't save them "for later" and never use them
4. **Describe your actions** — It's more fun for everyone
5. **Let the support player support** — Resist the urge to all attack; buffs matter
6. **Manage your hand** — Don't hoard resources past 12

*Together, you are more than heroes. You are the story itself.*
