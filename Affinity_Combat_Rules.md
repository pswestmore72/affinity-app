# Combat Rules

*how many actions -- Two, and movement counts as an action?*

## Attack Resolution

### Attack Sequence

1. **Declare attack, target, and exertion** (from your turn's exertion budget)
2. **Determine action tier and required successes**
3. **Roll Proficiency + Exertion dice**
4. **Count successes** (at or above Threshold = 1, 6 = 2)
5. **Check if required successes met**
6. **Calculate damage** (Base Impact + Extra Successes, capped at Proficiency)
7. **Burn HD for any 1s rolled on exertion dice**
8. **Target defends** (roll ½ Proficiency dice using their class HD type, each 5+ cancels 1 damage)
9. **Apply final damage**

**See Action Tiers section in Core Mechanics for Success Thresholds by tier.**

## Defense Actions

### Defend Action

Instead of attacking, you can take the **Defend** action:

- **Gain 2d6 bonus dice** for this round's defense rolls
- These are rolled as d6s and follow the same rules (5+ cancels damage)
- Can be combined with normal defense dice (temp HD/permanent HD rolled first, then bonus d6s)
- Lasts until start of your next turn

### Intervene (If have not yet acted in turn order)

Use an action to protect an ally within 5 yards:

**Action:** Basic (2+ threshold)
- Required: 1 success
- Effect: Each success cancels 1 HD damage to ally
- Uses exertion from your turn's budget

## Universal Actions

*These actions are available to all classes. Some classes may have abilities that interact with or modify these universal actions.*

### Rush (Adrenaline) — **WORK IN PROGRESS**

**This ability will be available to all classes. Each class may interact with it slightly differently based on their class design.**

**Action** (Basic, 2+)
- Roll Proficiency + Exertion dice
- For each success: Restore 1 HD
- 1s still burn HD (standard exertion risk)
- **Using Rush automatically costs 1 Resolve**

**The Choice:**
- Do I burn myself further to survive?
- Do I lose my morale position?
- Do I gamble survival on rolling more 1s?

**Design Intent:**
This creates a desperate moment where characters push beyond their limits. The Resolve cost means you're sacrificing mental fortitude for physical survival—trading long-term stability for immediate recovery. The exertion risk means you might burn more HD than you recover if you roll poorly. It's adrenaline as a double-edged sword.

*Class-specific variations and refinements to be developed during playtesting.*

## NPCs & Monsters

### Monster Stats

Enemies have simplified stats:

- **HD Pool:** Total Hit Dice
- **Proficiency:** Half their effective level
- **Attacks:** Dice pool + damage
- **Special Abilities:** Unique powers
*most monsters/ enemies are more likely to choose to exert (maybe can exert more) as they are wreckless and willing/needing to do anything to win*

**Example Monster:**

**Orc Raider (Level 3)**
- HD: 7d8
- Proficiency: 2
- Attack: Greataxe (Heavy, Basic)
  - Rolls: 3d6
  - Required: 1
  - Base: 2 HD (heavy weapon)
- Special: Blood Rage — When below half HD, +2 to attack rolls

---

## Environmental Combat

Some battlefields have **Lair Actions** or **Environmental Phases** that occur at specific initiative counts.

These create dynamic battlefields:
- Favor enemies on home terrain
- Force tactical repositioning
- Deal damage, impose conditions, or limit movement

---

## Damage Types

Some creatures resist or are vulnerable to specific damage types:

- **Physical:** Slashing, Piercing, Bludgeoning
- **Elemental:** Fire, Cold, Lightning, Thunder, Acid
- **Mystical:** Radiant, Necrotic, Force, Psychic

**Resistance:** Defender rolls +2d6 when defending against this type  
**Vulnerability:** Defender rolls -2d6 when defending against this type (minimum 0)  
**Immunity:** Automatically negate all damage of that type

---
