### NOTES & BACKSTORY

**Background:**
Grew up in Korshal's Undercroft. Learned early that survival isn't about strength—it's about efficiency. Every resource matters. Every advantage counts. The Coterie noticed when I cracked Merchant-Lord Valen's supposedly "unbreakable" vault... using three lockpicks and fifteen minutes. They want me. I want freedom. Tension there.

**Current Goals:**
- Avoid Coterie entanglements (easier said than done)
- Prove self-sufficiency is superior to guild reliance
- Accumulate enough wealth to disappear completely

**Bonds & Relationships:**
- **Harlan Vex** (Stonebridge) — noticed he has Coterie mannerisms. Watching him.
- **Party members** — useful allies, genuinely skilled, might actually trust them... eventually
- **The Coterie** — they own a piece of me (Shadowmark debt). Working to erase that.

**Character Moments:**
- *"You want a report on what's down there? Sure. But I'm keeping the interesting bits for myself."*
- First time working with people who don't expect betrayal. Unsettling.
- When Kael (Fighter) interposed to protect me from guardian: "...Thanks. Not used to that."

---

### ADVANCEMENT PLANS

**Level 3 Goals:**
- Unlock **Resource Cascade** (convert victories into resource restoration)
- Gain Feat improving Stealth or resource efficiency
- Add **Threshold Dancer** path node (operate at negative Resolve longer)

**Long-term Build:**
- Perfect resource conversion loops
- Become impossible to pin down or collapse
- Eventually unlock **Deny Death** (refuse to drop to 0 Resolve)
- "They can't kill what won't stay down."

---

*"Efficiency. Precision. Survival. In that order."*
