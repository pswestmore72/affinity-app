# Affinity System Review: Thoughts & Insights

*A fresh analysis of the Affinity TTRPG system — February 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

**Affinity is a philosophically coherent TTRPG that achieves something rare: mechanical systems that directly express thematic intent.** The Hit Dice destruction economy, the Custodial Powers framework, and the way cosmology flows into character classes all work together to create a unified vision of heroic commitment with real cost.

This isn't D&D with different dice. It's a ground-up reimagining of what fantasy RPG mechanics *mean*.

---

## I. What Works Exceptionally Well

### 1. The Hit Dice Economy — Elegance Through Destruction

The decision to make Hit Dice *individual dice that are destroyed* rather than a summed pool is the system's mechanical signature. This accomplishes several things simultaneously:

**Visceral Attrition:**
- Watching *individual dice* disappear from your pool creates psychological weight that "48 HP → 36 HP" cannot match
- Players literally hold fewer dice as combat progresses — the attrition is *tangible*
- Recovery becomes *gaining dice back*, not incrementing a number

**Exertion as Meaningful Risk:**
- The "1s burn HD" mechanic on exertion dice creates a genuine risk-reward tension
- Players can always push harder, but it *costs* something from the same pool they defend with
- This unifies offense, defense, and resource management into a single economy

**Tiered Success Without Bounded Accuracy:**
- The 2+/3+/4+/5+/6 threshold ladder is elegant — same dice, different math
- No need for modifiers or target numbers; the tier *tells you* how hard something is
- Explosive 6s (2 successes) create natural spike moments without "critical hit" rules

**Design Insight:** This is what makes Affinity feel like *commitment has cost*. The philosophy of "big actions require commitment, commitment risks collapse" is mechanically instantiated, not just flavor text.

### 2. The Custodial Powers — Theology as Game Architecture

The Concordant Halls, Living Accord, and Curator Arcanum are not just lore decoration. They are:

1. **Class Organizers** — Each power governs specific classes (Combatant/Priest → Concordant Halls; Ranger/Shaman → Living Accord; Scholar/Weaver → Curator Arcanum)
2. **Way Systems** — The Seven Charges, Seven Domains, and Six Paths provide the subclass structures
3. **Moral Framework** — "The cosmos does not judge the oath—only whether it is kept" allows morally complex characters without alignment systems

**The Crown-Breaking as Cosmic Wound:**
The recent addition connecting Azravael's Crown-Breaking to the *crystallization* of Custodial Powers is narratively brilliant:
- It explains *why* mortal powers have cosmic authority
- It makes the Custodial Powers feel like immune-system response, not arbitrary design
- Azravael proved law could be edited; the cosmos responded with powers *she cannot amend*

**Design Insight:** When your cosmology explains *why your game mechanics exist*, players internalize the world faster. The Path Board isn't arbitrary progression — it's "walking channels carved by the cosmos's response to Azravael's wound."

### 3. The Affinity System — Motivation Engine That Actually Works

The Affinity (virtue) system replaces backstories, origins, ancestries, and racial features with a single *motivation* that generates mechanical rewards:

**What It Does:**
- Players earn Affinity Dice (safe bonus d6s) by embodying their chosen virtue
- These can be stored and spent on any roll
- They can even be *shared with allies* ("Our purpose is shared")

**Why It Works:**
- It rewards *roleplay* with *mechanical benefit* without punishing non-optimal choices
- It replaces the "backstory you never use" problem with an active system
- The virtues span the entire moral spectrum (Guardian to Obligation to Suffering), allowing any character concept

**The Clean Economy:**
- Gain: Up to Proficiency times per day
- Store: Up to Level dice
- Spend: Any roll, no HD burn risk
- Share: Free action, transfer to allies

This is *generous enough to feel impactful* but *constrained enough to require choices*.

### 4. Combat Action Economy — Expert+ Restriction Is Clever

The rule that "only 1 Expert+ action per turn" solves multiple design problems:

1. **Prevents Nova Turns:** No stacking two Ultimate abilities in one round
2. **Preserves Dramatic Pacing:** Big moments feel big because they're singular
3. **Creates Tactical Depth:** Do you use your Expert action early or hold it?
4. **Maintains Class Balance:** Casters can't outpace martials by doubling spells

The "held action downgrades to Basic at end of round" mechanic is also smart — it creates risk for over-planning.

---

### 5. No Components, No Spell Slots — Commitment Cost Is *Health*

The explicit design decision to remove material components and spell slots is philosophically coherent:

> "Component requirements are narrative flavor, not mechanical tracking... Commitment should cost health, not coin."

This keeps the HD economy central to everything. A Weaver's fireball costs *risk of HD burn*, not "one diamond worth 50 gold." The resource you're spending is the same one you defend with.

---

## II. Areas of Design Elegance Worth Preserving

### 1. The Layer Defense System

The Shield → Armor → Body ablative system is easy to understand and creates natural narrative:
- Shield breaks first (dramatic!)
- Armor fails next (escalating desperation)
- Body dice are your final stand

The "defense capacity = rolls per attack, not per round" rule is important and non-obvious. Worth emphasizing in tutorials.

### 2. Skills as Context Domains

The choice to make Skills *categories that abilities key off of* rather than *trainable numbers* is unusual but elegant:
- Prevents "skill monkey" characters who monopolize checks
- Any character can *attempt* anything; expertise comes from abilities that *apply* in that context
- Forces GMs to call domains explicitly, which helps player memory

### 3. Rest vs. Recover Distinction

The two-tier rest system (Rest: partial recovery in danger; Recover: full reset in safety) creates resource-management tension that continues between combats. Players must decide when to push and when to retreat.

### 4. Way Branching Rules

The "branch one row lower than your current highest" rule for entering adjacent Ways is clean and creates meaningful trade-offs between depth (capstone) and breadth (versatility).

---

## III. Areas to Watch — Potential Friction Points

### 1. Cognitive Load for Ability Recall

The system asks players to:
- Remember which abilities apply to which Skill Domains
- Track multiple progression systems (Core, Ways, Paths)
- Invoke Affinity claims at appropriate moments

**The GM Guide addresses this** with prompting protocols and Domain Reference Cards, but new players may still struggle. Consider:
- Character sheet templates that explicitly list "Your best domains: X, Y, Z"
- Quick-reference cards by class
- Session 0 exercises where players practice invoking abilities

### 2. Resolve System Clarity

Resolve seems to serve multiple functions:
- Encounter clock (lose too much → flee/surrender)
- Concentration breaker (failed check → lose maintained spell)
- Legendary ability cost
- Morale tracker

This multivalence is powerful but may need clear summarization for players. A "Resolve Quick Reference" card might help.

### 3. Armor Repair Dependencies

The design choice that armor *doesn't auto-regenerate* and requires class abilities to repair creates party composition pressure:
- What if no one has repair abilities?
- Does this mean parties *need* a Craft-capable character?

This is probably intentional (rewarding diverse parties), but worth documenting the design intent clearly.

### 4. Affinity Virtue Selection Depth

The current Affinity options are strong (Memory, Communion, Guardian, Growth, Decay, Consequence, Flux, Freedom, Obligation, Suffering), but some feel more narratively rich than others:
- "Guardian" is broad enough to trigger frequently
- "Memory" and "Consequence" require more specific situations
- "Suffering" (Gephorix) may rarely trigger for non-villain characters

Consider: Are the trigger frequencies balanced? Do players equally want all virtues?

---

## IV. What Makes Affinity Unique

### 1. Moral Neutrality in Cosmic Powers

The consistent emphasis that Custodial Powers are *not aligned with good or evil* but with *commitment, balance, and limits* is philosophically mature for a fantasy RPG.

> "A Priest of Gephorix channels the Living Accord (suffering-as-transformation). A Combatant sworn to Azravael walks the Concordant Halls (contract-enforcement as purpose)."

This allows "villain" character concepts without requiring evil campaigns. The cosmos doesn't care *what* you're committed to—only that the commitment is real.

### 2. The Engine of Bael-Zaroth as Rules-Horror

The Engine is not just a Hell-analog. It's a *metaphysical horror of contract law*:

> "Intent is interpreted as consent. Metaphors become literal obligations. Ambiguous language auto-completes in Azravael's favor."

This is *terrifying* in the way cosmic horror should be — not through monsters, but through systems that trap you through technicalities. The "existence constitutes agreement" concept at extreme depths is genuinely nightmarish.

### 3. Deity Profiles That Feel Distinct

Each deity has clear domains, unique visual signatures, taboos, and practices. They're not just "god of X" — they have *personalities implied through mechanics*:
- Korthane's contracts are *finite* (opposed to Azravael's eternal debt)
- Gephorix doesn't distinguish agony from ecstasy (both are intensity)
- Velkir offers truths *stripped of context* (the corruption of knowledge without humility)

### 4. The Mortal Weave as Cosmic Exception

The framing that mortals are uniquely powerful *because* they can hold contradictions gods cannot is compelling:

> "A mortal can protect (Shield) someone they know deserves punishment (Blade). A mortal can cultivate life (Hearth) while preparing to destroy it (Howl)."

This gives player characters cosmic significance without making them demigods.

---

## V. Suggestions for Future Development

### 1. Complete the Affinity Dice System

The Character Creation document notes this is "a heavy work in progress." Priorities:
- Ensure every virtue has comparable trigger frequency
- Consider negative Affinity consequences (what happens when you *betray* your virtue?)
- Document whether virtues can change mid-campaign

### 2. Create Onboarding Materials

The depth of interconnected systems may overwhelm new players. Consider:
- **1-page quickstart**: Just enough to make characters and start playing
- **Reference cards**: Domain bonuses, action tiers, defense procedure
- **"First Session" campaign**: Pre-made scenario optimized for teaching

### 3. Expand Non-Combat Systems

The combat rules are thorough. Social encounters, exploration, downtime, and crafting could use similar depth:
- How does Influence work mechanically in extended negotiations?
- What are the Craft rules for creating items?
- How does travel/exploration interact with the rest system?

### 4. Document the Sovereign Class

The Sovereign ("Sovereign Self" pillar, d10, resource-efficiency master) appears in tables but isn't fully written. This class seems designed to represent *mortal independence from cosmic powers* — important for players who want to reject the Custodial framework.

### 5. Playtest the Extremes

The Hollow Below playtests have been valuable. Consider testing:
- Level 10 parties (does scaling break?)
- All-caster parties (is balance maintained?)
- Solo play (can one character survive?)
- Evil campaigns (do Obligation/Suffering virtues work?)

---

## VI. Final Assessment

**Affinity is philosophically disciplined.** Every major system — HD destruction, Custodial Powers, Affinity Dice, action tiers — points in the same direction: *commitment has meaning, and meaning has cost*.

The cosmology isn't decoration. It's architecture. Classes plug into cosmic powers. Subclasses express cosmic principles. Even the advancement systems (Ways, Paths) are framed as "walking channels carved by cosmic response."

**The risk** is complexity overwhelming players who just want to hit things with swords. But the GM Guide shows awareness of this problem.

**The opportunity** is a fantasy RPG where every mechanical choice carries thematic weight — where rolling dice to attack *is* an act of commitment-with-risk, not just "I swing my sword."

That's worth protecting.
