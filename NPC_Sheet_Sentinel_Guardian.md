---

### TACTICS & BEHAVIOR

**Combat Strategy:**
- **Phase 1 (40-20 HD):** Block doorway. Use Stone Fist to push back intruders. Grapple casters/ranged attackers.
- **Phase 2 (20-10 HD):** Become more aggressive. Focus on grappling to neutralize threats. Runes glow brighter (desperation).
- **Phase 3 (below 10 HD):** Retreat deeper into temple. Will not pursue if enemies don't follow.

**Defensive Positioning:**
- Always fights in doorways or narrow passages (uses Immovable to block)
- Protects temple hallways, not treasure
- Won't chase loot-grabbers who flee

**Motivation:**
Programmed to protect temple from desecration. Not evil—just absolute in duty. Interprets:
- Forced entry = threat
- Respectful approach + divine authority = possible ally
- Retreat = mission accomplished

**Personality Notes:**
- Mindless but not stupid (follows programmed logic)
- No speech, but gestures (raised hand = "stop", pointing = "leave")
- Can be "negotiated with" through divine magic or puzzle-solving (repairing door locks)
- If temple ley-node is stabilized, Guardian returns to alcove peacefully

**Victory Conditions:**
- Reduce Guardian to 0 HD (destroyed)
- Reduce Guardian to below 10 HD (retreats)
- Stabilize temple ley-node (Guardian deactivates peacefully)
- Solve door lock puzzle (Guardian steps aside)
- Demonstrate divine authority through Priest/Warlock magic (Guardian pauses, may allow passage)

**Retreat Conditions:**
- Below 10 HD: Retreat to deeper alcove
- Temple sanctified/stabilized: Return to dormancy
- Multiple guardians destroyed and ley-node threatened: Last guardian protects ley-node chamber directly

---

### LOOT & REWARDS

**On Defeat:**
- **Stone Core Shard** (crafting material — can be sold for 25 gold or used to craft stone-based magic items)
- Rune fragments (arcane research value)
- *Does NOT carry treasure — is the security system, not the vault*

**On Peaceful Resolution:**
- Guardian steps aside, grants passage
- Ancient holy symbol of Khuldras (found in alcove where Guardian rested)
- Party gains Khuldras's Favor (+1d6 to checks involving earth/stone/stability for this campaign)

**Experience Award:** 150 XP per Guardian defeated or bypassed

---

### DM NOTES

**Scaling Suggestions:**
- **For Level 1 Party:** Reduce HD to 30, lower Stone Fist damage to 2 HD
- **For Level 4+ Party:** Increase HD to 50, add legendary action (can make Stone Fist as reaction once per round)
- **Multiple Guardians:** Reduce individual HD pools by 25% if facing 3+ simultaneously

**Roleplay Tips:**
- Move slowly, deliberately (grinding stone sounds)
- Pause when shown divine magic (head tilt, processing)
- Gesture before attacking (raised hand = warning, then fist)
- If party tries talking, respond with gestures (point to door locks, gesture "solve this")
- Runes pulse with each action (blue light = active, dim = low HP)

**Environmental Factors:**
- **Narrow Hallways:** Guardian blocks completely, forcing single-file combat
- **Stone Floors:** Guardian has advantage on Immovable checks (solid footing)
- **Ley-Node Proximity:** Within 30 ft of ley-node chamber, Guardian regenerates 2 HD per round
- **Pillared Chambers:** Party can use pillars for cover, forcing Guardian to move (burning actions)

**Combat Duration Estimate:**
- **Aggressive Party (pure combat):** 4-5 rounds for skilled Level 2-3 party
- **Smart Party (grapple focus, environmental):** 3-4 rounds
- **Diplomatic Party (puzzle-solving):** 1-2 rounds to demonstrate authority, avoid combat entirely
