# Magic System

## Spell Cost Philosophy

**Spells cost what all actions cost: Hit Dice through exertion risk.**

Unlike physical actions, spells also have additional gates:
- **Knowledge Gate:** Must learn the spell (see Spell Learning below)
- **Preparation Gate:** Must prepare it during rest (limited slots)
- **Exertion Gate:** Must commit minimum exertion based on tier
- **Explicit Costs:** Some powerful spells explicitly burn HD or Resolve beyond exertion risk

**There are no material components to track, buy, or craft.** Component requirements are narrative flavor, not mechanical tracking. If a spell conceptually requires "moonlit water" or "sacred incense," the GM can make that a quest hook or ritual requirement, but it's not a consumable resource.

### Why No Components?

Your system already has spell cost built in:
- Basic/Advanced spells: Risk HD burn on 1s (organic cost)
- Expert+ spells: Require minimum exertion (guaranteed commitment)
- Legendary/Ultimate spells: Explicitly cost Resolve or HD (permanent consequences)

Adding gold-based components would create a "shopping trip tax" that competes with your core HD attrition economy. **Commitment should cost health, not coin.**

## Spellcasting System

### Domain Mastery & Prepared Spells

**There are no spell slots in this system.**

Instead, spellcasting uses:

**Known Spells:**
- You learn spells from your domain(s) as you advance
- Different classes learn different amounts:
  - **Weavers** know Proficiency × 5 spells (can learn from ANY domain: Arcane, Divine, or Primal)
  - **Priests** know Proficiency × 3 spells (Divine domain only)
  - **Rangers** know Proficiency × 3 spells (Primal domain only)
  - **Shamans** know Proficiency × 3 spells (Primal domain only)
  - **Scholars** know Proficiency × 3 spells (Arcane domain only)
- Spells are learned during advancement or by finding spell sources (scrolls, mentors, etc.)
- **Ritual Casting:** All casters can ritual cast ANY spell from their domain, even if not known (see Ritual Casting below)

### Ritual Casting

**All spellcasters can ritual cast any spell they know.**

**How Ritual Casting Works:**
- Cast any spell from your domain without spending HD or making exertion rolls
- You can ritual cast spells you don't know—as long as they're from your domain
- Requires uninterrupted time: 10 minutes per spell tier (Basic = 10 min, Expert = 40 min, etc.)
- Cannot be used in combat or time-pressured situations
- Spell takes effect at end of ritual
- If interrupted, ritual fails (no cost)

> **Why Prepare Spells?**
> 
> Prepared spells can be cast instantly in combat using your Exertion budget. Ritual casting takes 10+ minutes and cannot be used in time-pressured situations.
> 
> **Combat:** Use prepared spells (fast, costs HD risk)  
> **Downtime:** Use ritual casting (slow, no cost, works with any domain spell)

**When to Use Rituals:**
- Utility magic outside combat (divinations, wards, teleportation, crafting enchantments)
- Healing after battle when time permits
- Exploration magic (detecting traps, reading languages, communing with spirits)
- Social magic for long-term effects (charm, illusion, persuasion enhancement)

**Why This Matters:**
- Conserves HD/Resolve for combat
- Encourages creative non-combat spell use
- Rewards preparation and planning
- Makes casters feel versatile without being resource-starved

**Prepared Spells:**
- Spells you can actually cast in moment's notice
- You prepare these during a long rest from your domain spells
- **Prepared Spell Limit:**
  - **Weavers:** 3 + Level
  - **Most classes:** Proficiency + 1
- You can cast any prepared spell as many times as you have the will to fuel it
- Change prepared spells during long rest
- **Ritual casting doesn't require preparation**—you can ritual cast any domain spell

**Casting Limitation:**
Your ability to cast spells is limited by your Exertion Dice per action (= your Proficiency), not by spell slots. Each spell requires Exertion Dice to fuel it (subject to tier minimums).

## Multi-Target Spells

Many spells affect multiple targets through different mechanisms:

- **Area Spells (Radius, Cone, Line):** Roll once, all creatures in area affected, each defends individually, extra successes increase area size (not damage)
- **Multi-Select Spells (Chain Lightning, Mass Healing):** Choose specific targets, roll once, extra successes add more targets OR increase intensity
- **Sustained Zones (Wall of Flames, Sanctify Space):** Roll once when cast, zone persists for duration affecting anyone who enters

**Proficiency Scaling:** As you advance, extra successes allow you to affect larger areas or more targets (max = Proficiency scaling).

**See "Multi-Target Actions" in Combat Rules for complete mechanics, examples, and tactical guidance.**

---

## Spell Scrolls

**Spell scrolls are dangerous magic bottled for one-time use.**

### What Are Scrolls?

- Single-use spell inscriptions
- Contain a prepared spell ready to cast
- **Anyone can use them—caster or not**
- Consumed upon use (successful or failed)

### Creating Scrolls

Any spellcaster can inscribe scrolls of spells they know:

**Scroll Creation Requirements:**
- **Time:** 1 hour per spell tier
  - Basic spell = 1 hour
  - Advanced spell = 2 hours
  - Expert spell = 3 hours
  - Legendary spell = 4 hours
  - Ultimate spell = 5 hours
- **Materials:** Parchment, ink, ritual focus (cost: 10 gold × spell tier)
- **Skill Check:** Make Lore or Craft check (threshold = spell tier)
  - Basic spell = Basic 2+, 1 required
  - Advanced spell = Advanced 3+, 2 required
  - Expert spell = Expert 4+, 3 required
  - Legendary spell = Legendary 5+, 3 required
  - Ultimate spell = Ultimate 6, 4 required
- **On Success:** Scroll created successfully
- **On Failure:** Materials consumed, must start over

**Weavers and Scholars** gain +1d6 to scroll creation checks (their Polymathic Mind/Thread Literacy class features).

### Using Scrolls

**Casters Using Scrolls:**
- Roll normally (Proficiency + Exertion)
- Use spell's normal threshold and requirements
- Scroll is consumed whether you succeed or fail

**Non-Casters Using Scrolls:**
- **Roll ONLY Exertion Dice** (no Proficiency dice)
- Use spell's normal threshold and requirements
- Must commit minimum exertion for spell tier (Expert = 1 die minimum, Legendary = 2 dice minimum, Ultimate = 3 dice minimum)
- **Extreme Risk:** With no Proficiency dice, you rely entirely on exertion—and 1s burn HD
- Scroll is consumed whether you succeed or fail

**Example:** Non-caster uses Expert tier scroll (4+ threshold, 3 required successes). They must roll at least 1 exertion die (minimum for Expert). Rolling 5 exertion dice gives decent chance but risks burning 1-5 HD on 1s. This is why scrolls are "dangerous."

**Feat: Scroll Adept**
- **Prerequisite:** Trained in Lore
- **Benefit:** When using scrolls, you may roll your Lore skill dice in addition to Exertion (still no Proficiency dice unless you're a caster)
- Non-casters with this feat gain some reliability when using scrolls

### Scroll Market Values

| Spell Tier | Creation Cost | Market Value |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| Basic | 10 gold | 25-50 gold |
| Advanced | 20 gold | 75-100 gold |
| Expert | 30 gold | 200-300 gold |
| Legendary | 40 gold | 500-1000 gold |
| Ultimate | 50 gold | 2000-5000 gold |

**Why Create Scrolls?**
- Share spells with non-casters
- Create emergency reserves
- Sell for profit (market value > creation cost)
- Prepare spells you can't normally use (Rangers inscribing healing for emergency)
- Bypass preparation limits (Weavers bottling spells beyond their daily prep capacity)

## Casting Spells

### Spell Resolution

1. **Declare the spell, target(s), and exertion** (from your turn's exertion budget)
2. **Roll Proficiency + Exertion dice** (exertion budget = your Proficiency per action)
3. **Count successes** based on spell's threshold (at/above threshold = 1 success, 6 = 2 successes)
4. **Check if required successes met**
5. **Apply spell effects** (Base Impact + Extra Successes, **bonus capped at Proficiency**)
6. **Burn HD for any 1s rolled on exertion dice**

### Exertion Minimums for Spells

Spells follow the same exertion requirements as other actions:

| Tier | Threshold | Minimum Exertion Dice |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Basic** | 2+ | 0 |
| **Advanced** | 3+ | 0 |
| **Expert** | 4+ | 1 |
| **Legendary** | 5+ | 2 |
| **Ultimate** | 6 only | 3 |

You **must** commit at least this many exertion dice when casting spells of these tiers.

### Spell Structure

Each spell defines:
- **Threshold:** What die face counts as success (2+, 3+, 4+, 5+, 6)
- **Required:** Minimum successes needed for spell to work
- **Base Impact:** Effect if required successes met
- **Scaling:** How extra successes improve the effect (**bonus capped at Proficiency**)

---

## Concentration & Spell Duration

### Universal Rule: Maintaining a Spell

**When you maintain a spell through concentration:**
- **You cannot take Expert+ tier actions** (Expert, Legendary, Ultimate)
- You can still take Basic and Advanced actions
- The spell persists until you break concentration or it ends

**Concentration is broken when:**
- You take an Expert+ tier action
- You fall unconscious or die
- **You fail a Resolve check for any reason** (see Resolve section in Core Mechanics for triggers)
- You voluntarily end it (free action)

**Note:** Resolve checks are 1d6 (need 5+ to succeed), maximum 1 per round even if multiple triggers occur. Any failed Resolve check while concentrating ends the effect immediately.

### Spell Duration Types

**Concentration Spells:**
- Last as long as you maintain concentration
- Spell description lists "Concentration required" in Special section
- Duration limited by your focus, not a fixed time

**Fixed Duration Spells:**
- Last for stated duration after casting (rounds, minutes, hours)
- Do not require ongoing concentration
- End automatically when duration expires

**Instantaneous Spells:**
- Effect occurs immediately and ends
- No ongoing maintenance required

---

## Affinity & Planar Influence on Spells

**In Aligned Realm (your Custodial Power's domain):**
- Spell thresholds **reduced by 1** (minimum 2+)
- Example: Expert (4+) spell becomes Advanced (3+)

**In Opposed Realm (hostile Custodial Power's domain):**
- Spell thresholds **increased by 1** (maximum 6)
- Example: Advanced (3+) spell becomes Expert (4+)

**In Neutral Territory:**
- No modification to thresholds

See **Affinity & Custodial Influence** section for full planar mechanics.

## Spell Costs & Consequences

Some powerful spells don't just cost Exertion—they extract deeper prices.

**Spells may explicitly cost:**
- **HD:** Spell burns Hit Dice as part of its casting (separate from exertion burn)
- **Resolve:** Spell drains mental stamina or causes you to lose Resolve

These costs are **in addition to** normal exertion risks and are listed in the spell's description.

Example: *Power Word Kill* might require 4 successes (Ultimate tier), 3+ exertion dice, AND cost 2 Resolve to cast—representing the mental strain of commanding death itself.

## Spellcasting Classes

Each class interacts with magic differently—some are versatile scholars of the Weave, others channel focused domains through devotion or communion.

### Weaver (Spell Sovereign)
**Hit Die:** d6 (Fragile)  
**Connection:** The Curator Arcanum  
**Class Fantasy:** Reality reader who perceives and manipulates the Weave itself

**Spellcasting:**
- **Known Spells:** Proficiency × 5 (can learn from ANY domain: Arcane, Divine, or Primal)
- **Prepared Spells:** 3 + Level
- **Ritual Casting:** Can ritual cast any spell from any domain, even if not known
- **Unique Authority:** ONLY Weavers can cast Ultimate (6 only) tier spells
- **Thread Literacy:** Basic tier spells require 1 less exertion die (minimum 0)
- **Arcane Flexibility:** Can swap prepared spells during short rests (Proficiency spells only)

**Weaver Magic Philosophy:**  
You see reality's code. Every spell is an act of cosmic literacy. You are the most versatile spellcaster, able to access any magical tradition—but you are fragile (d6 HD). Your power is breadth and understanding, not focused devotion.

---

### Priest (Divine Conduit)
**Hit Die:** d8 (Balanced)  
**Connection:** The Concordant Halls, Empyreal Accord, or patron deities  
**Class Fantasy:** Faith-powered warrior channeling cosmic will through Power Words and divine magic

**Spellcasting (Limited Spellcasting):**
- **Known Spells:** Proficiency × 3 (Divine domain only)
- **Prepared Spells:** Proficiency + 1
- **Ritual Casting:** Can ritual cast any Divine spell, even if not known
- **Spell Limitation:** Cannot cast Ultimate tier spells (that belongs to Weavers)

**Power Words (Class Abilities, NOT Spells):**  
Priests have **Power Words**—direct invocations of cosmic powers that function as class abilities with Resolve costs and usage limits:
- **Power Word: Endure** (Level 1): Restore HD to allies, costs Resolve
- **Power Word: Smite** (Level 1): Advanced (3+) attack dealing Proficiency HD (or Prof × 2 vs opposed creatures), costs 1 Resolve, usable Prof times per short rest
- **Power Word: Sanctify** (Level 3): Expert (4+) zone control with domain-aligned benefits
- **Power Word: Transcend** (Level 5): Expert (4+) empowerment of self/ally, costs 2 Resolve
- **Power Word: Annihilate** (Level 5): Expert (4+) devastating single-target attack, costs 3 Resolve

**Priest Magic Philosophy:**  
Your magic is twofold: **Limited Spellcasting** (prayers and rituals using normal spell mechanics) and **Power Words** (class abilities fueled by Resolve that bypass spell preparation). You are focused—narrower than a Weaver's versatility, but aligned with greater cosmic purpose. Your convictions have weight.

---

### Ranger (Wilderness Ritualist)
**Hit Die:** d8 (Balanced)  
**Connection:** The Living Accord  
**Class Fantasy:** Terrain master who weaponizes environments and communes with nature

**Spellcasting (Limited Spellcasting):**
- **Known Spells:** Proficiency × 3 (Primal domain only)
- **Prepared Spells:** Proficiency + 1
- **Ritual Casting:** Can ritual cast any Primal spell, even if not known
- **Spell Limitation:** Cannot cast Ultimate tier spells

**Ranger Magic Philosophy:**  
Your magic bends terrain, controls movement, weaponizes environments, and augments your wilderness mastery. You don't reshape reality like Weavers—you make nature fight for you. Spells are tools for preparation, not your primary power source. You win battles through positioning, not raw magical force.

---

### Shaman (Spirit Communer)
**Hit Die:** d6 (Fragile)  
**Connection:** The Living Accord  
**Class Fantasy:** Threshold walker who exists between mortal and spirit realms

**Spellcasting (Limited Spellcasting):**
- **Known Spells:** Proficiency × 3 (Primal domain only)
- **Prepared Spells:** Proficiency + 1
- **Ritual Casting:** Can ritual cast any Primal spell, even if not known
- **Spell Limitation:** Cannot cast Ultimate tier spells

**Spirit Communion (Class Abilities, NOT Spells):**  
Shamans have unique class abilities that invite spirits to manifest through or near them:
- **Spirit Communion** (Level 1): Invite Ancestor/Elemental/Beast/Death spirits, gain domain-specific benefits
- **Manifest Spirit** (Level 3): Bring spirit fully into reality as controllable entity
- **Spirit Embodiment** (Level 5): Transform into spirit-fused form
- **Living Threshold** (Level 5): Tear portal between mortal and spirit realms

**Shaman Magic Philosophy:**  
Your magic is relational—spirits answer when you call, if you maintain the relationship. Spells represent negotiations with spiritual forces. Your class abilities (Spirit Communion, Manifestation, Embodiment) are what make you unique—not your spell list. You don't cast elemental magic; you invite elemental spirits to act.

---

### Scholar (Knowledge Weaponizer)
**Hit Die:** d8 (Balanced)  
**Connection:** The Curator Arcanum  
**Class Fantasy:** Pattern identifier who weaponizes information and understanding

**Spellcasting (Limited Spellcasting):**
- **Known Spells:** Proficiency × 3 (Arcane domain only)
- **Prepared Spells:** Proficiency + 1
- **Ritual Casting:** Can ritual cast any Arcane spell, even if not known
- **Spell Limitation:** Cannot cast Ultimate tier spells
- **Scroll Mastery:** Can create spell scrolls during downtime (see Scroll Creation rules)

**Scholar Magic Philosophy:**  
Your magic represents formulas and theories made manifest—formulaic, not intuitive. You are not a full caster like Weavers; your primary power is **pattern recognition and tactical advantage engineering** (class abilities: Analyze, Expose Weakness, Systemic Advantage). Spells augment your knowledge-based approach but are not your core identity.

---

### Non-Spellcasting Classes

**Combatant** and **Sovereign** do not have spellcasting. Their power comes entirely from class abilities, combat mastery, and Path Board choices. They represent peak martial/physical excellence without magical augmentation (though they may use magic items, scrolls, or gain magical effects through their oaths/connections to Custodial Powers).
