# Classes

## Class Fantasy & Progression

*Every class needs defined and unique class fantasy*
*Every class needs to be able to perform all 5 action types (Basic, Advanced, Expert, Legendary, Ultimate)*
*All classes should lean into elements from the Custodial Powers and other reality shaping forces within the cosmology*

**IMPORTANT:** Classes have TWO progression systems working in parallel:

### Core Progression (Every Level)
*At every level (1-10), you gain core mechanics, abilities, or class fantasy elements that define your class.*
*Odd levels (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) deliver major new abilities with escalating action tiers.*
*Even levels (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) deliver passive upgrades and your Way node.*
*Level 1 starts with foundational abilities; each subsequent level builds on your core class fantasy.*

### Ways (Class-Specific Subclass Specialization)
*All classes have a **Way** system—subclass specializations that deepen your chosen fantasy.*
*You gain one Way node on **EVEN LEVELS ONLY (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)** — 5 nodes total.*
*Ways are organized as grids: **columns** (one per Custodial Power subcategory) **× 5 rows** (rows correspond to even levels 2/4/6/8/10).*
*Columns form a **ring** — the first and last columns are adjacent, so every Way has exactly two neighbors.*
*Ways shouldn't generate raw power—they augment class abilities and strengthen class fantasy.*
*Choose your Way at **Level 1**, gain your first node at **Level 2**, then progress through the grid.*

**Column counts by Custodial Power:**
- **Concordant Halls** (Combatant, Priest): 7 columns — Shield, Blade, Bond, Crown, Flame, Stone, Bell
- **Living Accord** (Ranger, Shaman): 7 columns — Breath, Thorn, Tide, Rot, Hearth, Star, Howl
- **Curator Arcanum** (Scholar, Weaver): 6 columns — Moments, Thresholds, Unleashed Force, Mutable Flesh, Open Doors, Veiled Sight
- **Sovereign Self** (Sovereign): 5 columns — Sealed Gate, Keen Edge, Still Water, Tempered Forge, Unbroken

*Two classes sharing a Custodial Power have the same column NAMES but different node effects. A Combatant's "Way of the Shield" is martial guardianship; a Priest's is divine warding. Same cosmic principle, different class expression.*

### Way Progression Rules

1. At **Level 1**, choose a starting Way (column). At **Level 2**, gain that Way's Row 1 node.
2. At each subsequent even level (4, 6, 8, 10), choose ONE:
   - **Advance:** Take the next row in a Way you've already started.
   - **Branch:** Enter an adjacent Way at one row *below* your current highest node. (From Row 3, you may branch to an adjacent Way's Row 2.)
3. You may only branch into a Way that is **adjacent** (ring neighbors) to one you've already started.
4. Going straight down one column (all 5 rows) grants the powerful **Row 5 capstone**. Branching grants breadth at the cost of depth.

### Paths (General Feat System)
*This is SEPARATE from Ways. See **Affinity_Path_Board.md** for the general feat system.*
*Paths are broad, non-class-specific character customization gained at: **Level 1 (Primary Feat), Level 3, Level 6, Level 9, Level 10***
*Paths allow cross-class builds: A Combatant can take Shadow Step, a Priest can take War-Trained, etc.*

### Level Progression Summary

| 1 | 1 | Major abilities | — | Primary Feat |
| 2 | 1 | Passive upgrade | Row 1 | — |

| 10 | 5 | Capstone | Row 5 | Feat |

## Combatant

*Combatant is the master of the battlefield and of armor and weaponry*
*Paths will reflect areas of the Battle/Fighting Styles/Weapon Masteries, most Combatants are tied to The Concordant Halls, but any Custodial Power from any plane can bring about Combatants*
*All Combatants can use Medium Armor and all Weaponry, have a mastery over weaponry*
*They have total understanding and advantage in battlefield tactics, layouts, environmental actions*
*They all have weapon attacks as slams, shots, strikes...*
*They all have Battle Cries/Yells to influence, bolster, fear, enrage allies and enemies... various paths augment these yells just as they do fighting styles*

**Hit Die:** d10 (Tough)
**Custodial Connection:** The Concordant Halls — Keepers of Oath and Purpose
**Role:** Battlefield Master, Oath-Bound Warrior

### Class Identity

Combatants are warriors who have bound themselves to something greater than survival. Through the recognition of the **Concordant Halls**, their oaths gain metaphysical weight—each strike carries purpose, each stand reinforces commitment. They are masters of armor, weaponry, and battlefield control, wielding not just steel but the accumulated force of sworn intent.

**The Concordant Halls do not judge what is sworn—only that commitment is real.** Paladins of Azravael, mercenaries bound by contract-oath, executioners serving the Black Reliquary, shield-bearers protecting tyrants—all walk the Halls equally if their purpose is true. Morality is for gods. The Halls recognize only **will made manifest**.

**Core Fantasy:**
You are purpose made manifest in combat. Your weapon is an extension of your oath—whatever that oath may be. The battlefield bends to those who know why they fight. You are durable, skilled, and when you speak your oath aloud, reality itself reinforces your will.

---

### The Cosmic Truth of the Combatant's Ways

*The Concordant Halls do not care whether you protect tyrants or liberators. They care whether you hold the line.*

Every Way below represents a principle that exists across the entire cosmos—in the angelic legions of the Empyreal Accord, in the contract-enforcers of Bael-Zaroth's Engine, in the pack-oaths of the Wild Expanse, in the silent witnesses of the Gloam.

When you walk a Combatant's Way, you are not claiming virtue. You are claiming *commitment*. The cosmos does not judge your oath—only whether you keep it.

---

#### Way of the Shield
*Protection, guardianship, sanctuary*
*Adjacent: Bell, Blade*

**Row 1: Shield Wall** — When you end your turn adjacent to an ally, that ally gains +1d6 to their next defense roll (doesn't burn HD).

## Priest

*Priest are bound with powers far beyond themselves, they serve to bring about the will of the most powerful in the cosmos*
*They steady Resolve, They prevent collapse, They sanctify space, make battle sites holy, They turn collapse into sacrifice, They can turn loss/failure of an ally into the driving force for greatness of another*
*Paths will reflect areas of the invocation/bringing out the power of the gods/cosmos, most Priests are tied to The Concordant Halls, but any Custodial Power from any plane can bring about Priests*
*All Priests can use Light Armor and all Weaponry, though no mastery like the Combatants. They can all cast some level of spells, though less than the Weaver.*
*They have total understanding and advantage in matters of Will, Resolve, Health, Stamina, Endurance*
*They all have "Power Words" - direct invocations of greater powers*
*They are not just healers, not just support batteries, not just undead/evil executioners, not just radiant cannons*

**Hit Die:** d8 (Balanced)
**Custodial Connection:** Any Custodial Power — Conduits of Greater Will
**Role:** Invoker, Resolve Anchor, Space Sanctifier

### Class Identity

Priests are mortal vessels who channel powers far beyond themselves. They do not wield magic through study like Weavers, nor through personal oaths like Combatants—they invoke the will of forces that dwarf mortal comprehension. Through **Power Words**, they speak reality into compliance, steadying the collapsing, sanctifying the profane, transforming loss into sacrifice with purpose.

**A Priest may serve any power.** The righteous crusader channeling Nyroth's protection, the plague priest spreading Gephorix's despair, the death-speaker carrying Aralys's mercy—all are Priests if they have become conduits for something greater. **The cosmos does not judge. It only asks: do you carry the signal clearly?**

**Core Fantasy:**
You are a relay point between the mortal and the infinite. When companions falter, your words hold them upright. When spaces turn hostile, your presence sanctifies them. When death comes, you decide if it's sacrifice or waste.

### Ways of the Concordant Halls

**Grid Structure (Ring):**
```
Shield ←→ Blade ←→ Bond ←→ Crown ←→ Flame ←→ Stone ←→ Bell ←→ (Shield)
```

---

### The Cosmic Truth of the Priest's Ways

*The Concordant Halls are older than the gods Priests serve. The oaths that bind divinity itself flow through these channels.*

A Priest walks the same Seven Charges as a Combatant—but where the Combatant embodies martial commitment, the Priest channels *divine* commitment. The Shield that guards a battlefield is the same Shield that wards a sanctuary. The Bell that tolls accountability on the corpse-field is the same Bell that speaks prophecy in temples.

Your patron may be merciful or merciless. The Concordant Halls care only that your service is *true*.

---

#### Way of the Shield
*Divine protection, warding, sanctuary*
*Adjacent: Bell, Blade*

**Row 1: Warding Word** — Power Word: Endure also grants target +1d6 to their next defense roll.

**Row 2: Sanctified Barrier** — Your Sanctify zone grants allies within +1 temporary HD (die matching their class type). Lasts until zone ends.

**Row 3: Shield of Faith** — Once per short rest (reaction), grant one ally within 30 yards an automatic success on their next defense roll.

**Row 4: Protected Domain** — Enemies in your Sanctify zone cannot use Legendary or Ultimate abilities (only Basic-Expert).

**Row 5: Divine Sanctuary** *(Legendary, 5+)* — Once per long rest, create 30-yard zone for Prof rounds where hostile actions automatically fail. Creatures in combat may contest (Prof dice vs yours) to resist.

#### Way of the Blade
*Divine judgment, smiting, righteous wrath*
*Adjacent: Shield, Bond*

**Row 1: Focused Wrath** — Smite costs 0 Resolve against creatures directly opposed to your patron.

**Row 2: Righteous Cascade** — When Smite reduces a target to 0 HD, regain the Resolve spent.

**Row 3: Judgment Aura** — While Sanctify is active, weapon attacks within the zone deal +Prof HD divine damage.

**Row 4: Divine Executioner** — Annihilate damage increases by Prof HD against creatures who have harmed your patron's servants within the last hour.

**Row 5: Word of Undoing** *(Legendary, 5+)* — Once per long rest, one creature within 60 yards that acted against your patron makes Resolve check at -4d6. Failure = lose ALL Resolve. Success = lose 2.

#### Way of the Bond
*Communion, shared faith, collective healing*
*Adjacent: Blade, Crown*

**Row 1: Communal Restoration** — When you use Endure, one additional ally within 10 yards of the target also restores 1 HD.

**Row 2: Shared Suffering** — When an ally within 30 yards would lose 2+ HD from a single source, absorb 1 of that damage onto yourself.

**Row 3: Chain of Faith** — Once per short rest, chain you + Prof allies within 30 yards. For Prof rounds, when any chained ally restores HD, all others restore 1 HD.

**Row 4: Bonds Beyond Death** — When a chained ally would drop to 0 HD, they stay at 1 instead. Once per ally per long rest.

**Row 5: Communion of Purpose** *(Legendary, 5+)* — Once per long rest, merge spiritual essence of Prof allies within 30 yards for Prof rounds. All share highest Proficiency, gain +2d6 to all actions, and when one succeeds all others gain +1d6 next action.

#### Way of the Crown
*Divine authority, commanding presence*
*Adjacent: Bond, Flame*

**Row 1: Voice of Authority** — Your Power Words are heard through any noise, in any language, and cannot be silenced by mundane means.

**Row 2: Consecrated Command** — Once per short rest, command one creature within 30 yards to perform a single non-harmful action (kneel, halt, speak truth). Contest (their Prof vs yours); failure = obey.

**Row 3: Aura of Dominion** — Enemies within 10 yards have -1d6 on all actions against your allies.

**Row 4: Crown of the Faithful** — Sanctify lets you choose TWO zone effects (stacks with Greater Domain for three at L7+).

## Ranger

*Ranger are bound to a reverence for nature, for the hunt, for the beautiful harsh wilds*
*Reduces or negates travel-based Resolve loss, Lowers Threshold requirements in wilderness scenes*
*Most Rangers are tied to The Living Accord, but any Custodial Power from any plane can bring about Rangers*
*All Rangers can use Medium Armor and all Weaponry, though no mastery like the Combatants. They can all cast some level of spells, though significantly less than the Weaver.*
*"The Ranger decides where and how you suffer.", "The wild obeys the Ranger.", "The Ranger wins before the fight begins."*
*Not just ranged DPS, not just a Nature-flavored Fighter, not just the Pet-dependent class*

**Hit Die:** d8 (Balanced)
**Custodial Connection:** The Living Accord — Keepers of Life and Death Balance
**Role:** Wilderness Master, Terrain Controller, Hunter

### Class Identity

Rangers are not merely wilderness survivors—they are those who have learned to read the natural world's code and rewrite the rules of engagement. Connected to the **Living Accord**, they understand that nature is neither kind nor cruel; it simply *is*, and mastery comes from deciding where growth ends and culling begins. They do not fight *in* the wilds—they make the wilds fight *for* them.

**Core Fantasy:**
You decide where the battle happens, what it costs to get there, and who suffers along the way. While others react to terrain, you weaponize it. The fight is half over before it begins because you chose the ground and set the terms. The wild doesn't love you. It obeys you.

## Scholar

*Scholar are the master of knowledge, weaponizing it, letting it guide and grant aid or making others suffer by it.*
*They should control structure, understanding, and inevitability*

**Custodial Connection:** The Curator Arcanum — Keepers of Knowledge and Humility

They are not magic users who studied—they are knowledge wielders who learned that understanding something completely is the first step to controlling it.

**Core Fantasy:**
You see patterns others miss. In combat, you identify weaknesses before striking. In conversation, you understand motivation before it's spoken. In creation, you build what others think impossible. You don't force outcomes. You architect them.

## Shaman

*Shaman are the embodiment of the Spirit expressed... they manifest, they commune with the accords. Where Rangers embody the wilds and the tangible terrain... Shamans embody "what is beyond"*
*Life and Death, Stone and Air, Fire and Water, Mortal and spirit, Self and Affinity; Shaman communes with consequence*
*Most Shamans are tied to The Living Accords, but any Custodial Power from any plane can bring about Shamans*
*They have total understanding of the spirit, of the liminal spaces, of what is beyond and between what others perceive*
*They are not just an Elemental blaster, not just another Healer, not Just "nature magic"*

**Hit Die:** d6 (Fragile)
**Custodial Connection:** The Living Accord — Walkers Between Life and Death
**Role:** Spirit Communer, Threshold Walker, Liminal Channeler

### Class Identity

Shamans do not master the physical world like Rangers—they commune with what lies *beyond* it. They walk the thresholds between life and death, self and other, stone and spirit. Connected to the **Living Accord**, they understand that reality has two faces: the tangible world others see, and the spirit realm that underlies it. Where Rangers weaponize terrain, Shamans bridge worlds. Where Priests channel greater will, Shamans *merge* with it.

**Core Fantasy:**
You exist between states. While others are fully here or fully there, you walk both worlds. You don't cast elemental magic—you commune with elemental spirits and they answer. You don't heal mechanically—you balance life and death in the moment. The price is never being fully yourself. The power is never being *only* yourself.

## Sovereign

*The Sovereign: "Where others draw from the cosmos, I draw from myself."*
*They are the proof that the universe's structure is not absolute. They are the crack in the metaphysical system.*
*This class masters resource efficiency—manipulating HD, Exertion, and Resolve through perfect internal control*
*Paths will reflect martial disciplines and internal philosophies — stances, forms, meditation techniques*
*All Sovereigns can use Light and Medium Armor and all Weaponry. They cannot cast spells — they need nothing external.*
*Their Role: Resource efficiency expert and last-one-standing specialist*

**Hit Die:** d10 (Tough)
**Custodial Connection:** Any or None — Self-Sufficient Anomaly
**Role:** Resource Master, Endurance Specialist, Unbreakable Duelist

### Class Identity

Sovereigns are masters of internal economy. While others burn resources frantically, Sovereigns have perfected the art of using exactly what is needed—no more, no less. They do not reject cosmic power; they simply prove it unnecessary. Through meditation, discipline, and absolute self-knowledge, they manipulate their own thresholds, converting between resources and operating when others would collapse.

**Sovereigns can be recognized by any Custodial Power—or by none.** The duelist who never wastes a motion, the ascetic who walks for days without rest, the condemned who refuses death through pure will—all are Sovereigns when they prove that perfected self-control surpasses borrowed power.

**Core Fantasy:**
You are a closed system, perfectly efficient. Every point of HD, every die of Exertion, every point of Resolve—you know exactly where it goes and what it buys. You are not flashy. You are *efficient*. And efficiency means you're still fighting when everyone else has collapsed.

```

#### Way of the Sealed Gate
*Defensive perfection, impenetrable form*
*Adjacent: Unbroken, Keen Edge*

**Row 1: Iron Defense** — Using 0 Exertion this turn grants +2d6 defense (up from +1d6 via Centered Strike's Economy Bonus interaction with defense).

**Row 2: Deflection** — Once per round when hit, reduce HD damage by Prof (flat reduction before dice destroyed).

**Row 3: Counter-Guard** — When all defense dice survive an attack, free Weapon Strike against attacker (if in reach). Prof times per short rest.

**Row 4: Impenetrable Form** — Armor dice one size larger (d6→d8, d8→d10, d10→d12). Body dice survive on 4+ instead of 5+.

**Row 5: Absolute Defense** *(Legendary, 5+)* — Once per long rest, Prof rounds: auto-succeed all defense rolls (no dice destroyed). May attack normally. Lose 3 Resolve when it ends.

#### Way of the Keen Edge
*Offensive efficiency, lethal economy*
*Adjacent: Sealed Gate, Still Water*

**Row 1: Efficient Strike** — Centered Strike's Prof damage bonus applies even when using Exertion (not just 0 Exertion).

**Row 2: Waste Nothing** — Excess damage beyond outermost defense layer carries to next layer (no wasted damage).

**Row 3: Economy of Violence** — Once per short rest on hit: deal normal damage + target loses 1 Resolve, OR deal Prof × 2 HD. Maximum effect.

**Row 4: Surgical Precision** — Your attacks ignore 2 defense dice (target rolls 2 fewer, min 0).

**Row 5: Death by Efficiency** *(Legendary, 5+)* — Once per long rest, Perfect Strike: auto-hit, Prof × 3 HD, ignores armor (targets body), target Resolve check at -Prof d6.

#### Way of the Still Water
*Mental mastery, counter-arts, awareness*
*Adjacent: Keen Edge, Tempered Forge*

**Row 1: Read Intent** — Start of combat: know each enemy's primary target for first action.

**Row 2: Counter Stance** — Once per round, when enemy misses you, their next action has -2d6.

**Row 3: Mind Like Water** — Immune to surprise. Once per combat, choose to act first regardless of initiative.

**Row 4: Reflective Mind** — Once per short rest, when mental effect targets you, auto-succeed AND reflect it onto caster (they save against their own effect).

**Row 5: Perfect Clarity** *(Legendary, 5+)* — Once per long rest, Prof rounds: know every enemy action before they take it (reposition ally or self 10 yards as reaction to each), +2d6 all attacks, immune to ALL conditions.

#### Way of the Tempered Forge
*Resource alchemy perfection, endurance*
*Adjacent: Still Water, Unbroken*

**Row 1: Efficient Metabolism** — Short rest: restore Prof additional HD. Body wastes nothing.

**Row 2: Refined Conversion** — Resolve → Endurance prevents Prof × 2 HD loss (stacks with L8 upgrade for Prof × 4 at high level).

**Row 3: Secondary Alchemy** — New conversion: once per round, spend 2 HD for +2d6 on next action (these dice don't burn HD).

**Row 4: Perpetual Engine** — Efficiency Banking grants +2d6 instead of +1d6. Taking 0 damage on a round restores 1 HD.

**Row 5: Transcendent Alchemy** *(Legendary, 5+)* — Once per long rest, Prof rounds: all Internal Alchemy has no limits, Exertion never burns HD (1s become 2s), restore 2 HD per turn end. Lose 2 Resolve when it ends.

#### Way of the Unbroken
*Survival defiance, last-one-standing*
*Adjacent: Tempered Forge, Sealed Gate*

**Row 1: Stubborn Will** — When failing Resolve check, spend 1 HD to reroll. Once per check.

**Row 2: Defiance Threshold** — Deny Death usable Prof times per long rest (up from once).

**Row 3: Unbreakable Body** — Once per long rest, when dropping to 0 HD, instead drop to Prof HD.

**Row 4: Rising Stronger** — Each time Deny Death or Unbreakable Body triggers, gain +2d6 to all actions for Prof rounds.

**Row 5: Sovereign Immortality** *(Legendary, 5+)* — Once per long rest, when you would die, refuse. Stand at 1 HD, 1 Resolve, gain a full extra turn. All attacks this turn auto-hit, max damage. After: Resolve check — fail = collapse to 0 everything, success = 1 HD, 1 Resolve.
