# Spell Compendium

This section contains all spells available to spellcasting classes. Spells are organized by **Domain** (Primal, Divine, Arcane) and **Tier** (Basic, Advanced, Expert, Legendary, Ultimate).

**Spell Costs:** Spells cost what all actions cost—Hit Dice through Exertion risk. When you roll Exertion dice to cast, any 1s burn HD. Higher-tier spells require minimum exertion dice (Expert = 1, Legendary = 2, Ultimate = 3). Some spells have explicit costs listed in their Special sections (Resolve or HD). Any material references in spell descriptions ("Heartwood from ancient tree", "Sacred relic") are narrative flavor for quest hooks, not mechanical tracking.

## Understanding Spell Domains

The three spell domains reflect different relationships with cosmic power:

### Primal Domain (The Living Accord)
- **Philosophy:** Balance through cycles—life and death, growth and decay, nurture and prune
- **Power Source:** Natural forces, spirits, elemental energies
- **Casting Feel:** Invoking the wild, channeling nature's fury or grace
- **Available To:** Rangers, Shamans, Weavers
- **Themes:** Transformation, summoning, elemental damage, healing through natural restoration

### Divine Domain (Custodial Powers)
- **Philosophy:** Purpose through devotion—oaths made manifest, faith as power
- **Power Source:** Concordant Halls (Oath), Empyreal Accord, patron deities
- **Casting Feel:** Sacrifice, commitment, channeling divine will through your conviction
- **Available To:** Priests, Weavers
- **Themes:** Radiant damage, protection, sacrifice mechanics, zones of sanctity, resurrection

### Arcane Domain (The Curator Arcanum)
- **Philosophy:** Understanding through humility—knowledge of the Weave's patterns
- **Power Source:** The Weave itself, reality's underlying structure
- **Casting Feel:** Precise manipulation, editing reality's code, scholarly mastery
- **Available To:** Scholars, Weavers
- **Themes:** Force damage, unraveling magic, teleportation, time/reality manipulation, pure utility

**Weavers' Unique Position:** Weavers can access ALL three domains because they study magic itself rather than channeling through a specific relationship. This makes them the most versatile spellcasters but without the focused class abilities of specialists.

## Class Spell Access

| Scholar | Arcane + some Divine (Basic-Expert) | Legendary+, Primal domain |
| Shaman | Primal + some Arcane (Basic-Expert) | Legendary+, Divine domain |

---

## Legendary Tier Spells (5+)

*Epic spells requiring minimum 2 exertion dice. Some Legendary spells reference specific materials in their descriptions ("Heartwood from ancient tree", "Sacred relic", etc.)—these are narrative requirements that the GM may use as quest hooks, but are not consumable tracked resources.*

### Primal Domain (Legendary)

**Invoke the Accord's Judgment**
- **Domain:** Primal | **Tier:** Legendary (5+), Required: 3
- **Base Impact:** Call upon The Living Accord to judge all creatures in 40-yard radius. Each creature must contest:

  - If disrupting cycles carelessly: Take Proficiency HD damage + 1 Resolve loss
- **Scaling:** +10 yards radius per extra success
- **Range:** 60 yards
- **Special:** The Accord judges all equally—including you and allies. On failure, you are judged harshly and lose 2 Resolve immediately.

### Divine Domain (Legendary)

**Avatar of the Patron**
- **Domain:** Divine | **Tier:** Legendary (5+), Required: 3

  - Your form shifts to reflect patron's nature
- **Scaling:** +1 round duration per extra success
- **Duration:** Proficiency + extra rounds

### Arcane Domain (Legendary)

**Rewrite the Weave**

- **Scaling:** +1 additional rewrite per extra success (can affect multiple events)
- **Range:** 60 yards (must see original event)
- **Special:** This spell represents editing reality's record. Curator Arcanum warns against its use—knowledge of what "could have been" breeds dangerous hubris. On failure, both versions occur simultaneously (GM determines chaotic overlapping consequences). Cost: Lose 2 Resolve from seeing two timelines.

---

## Ultimate Tier Spells (6 only)

*Reality-warping spells requiring minimum 3 exertion dice. ONLY WEAVERS CAN CAST. Some Ultimate spells reference legendary materials ("Essence of a dying world", "Thread from the Weave itself", etc.)—these are narrative requirements representing the magnitude of power being invoked, not mechanical components to purchase.*

### Primal Domain (Ultimate)

**Collapse of the Accord** *(Restore)*
- **Domain:** Primal | **Tier:** Ultimate (6 only), Required: 4
- **Base Impact:** Target 40-yard radius. All creatures in area:
  - Instantly restored to full HD
  - Restore to 5 Resolve (maximum)
  - All conditions removed
  - **BUT**: Area becomes permanently scarred (dead zone where nothing grows for years)
- **Scaling:** +10 yards radius per extra success
- **Range:** 100 yards
- **Special:** You force The Living Accord to sacrifice the land's future to save the present. This is the ultimate violation of balance—you will be marked by the Accord forever. Cost: You permanently lose 1 point of Proficiency (recalculate all derived stats). On failure, everyone in radius loses 3 Resolve instead, including you.

### Divine Domain (Ultimate)

**Invoke True Name**
- **Domain:** Divine | **Tier:** Ultimate (6 only), Required: 5
- **Base Impact:** Speak target's true name as your patron understands it. Target must contest using only their Proficiency dice (no exertion, no skills). If they fail:
  - They immediately drop to 0 HD and 0 Resolve
  - They must obey one command from you (duration: until command fulfilled or 24 hours pass)
  - After effect ends, they know you hold power over their name
- **Scaling:** Each extra success adds +1 to required contest successes for target
- **Range:** Must see and hear target (any distance if conditions met)
- **Special:** True names are metaphysical identities known only to cosmic powers. Your patron shares this knowledge—the price is steep. Cost: Permanently lose 1 maximum Resolve (your new maximum is 4). On failure, YOUR true name is revealed to target and they gain same power over you for 24 hours.

### Arcane Domain (Ultimate)

**Reforge Reality**
- **Domain:** Arcane | **Tier:** Ultimate (6 only), Required: 4
- **Base Impact:** Alter one fundamental aspect of reality within 30-yard radius for 10 minutes:
  - Gravity direction changes
  - Time flows at half/double speed
  - All fire becomes ice (or vice versa)
  - Solid objects become ethereal (or vice versa)
  - One elemental damage type swaps with another
- Choose one fundamental change. It affects ALL instances within radius.
- **Scaling:** +5 minutes duration per extra success
- **Duration:** 10 minutes + scaling
- **Range:** 30 yards
- **Special:** This is why the Curator Arcanum teaches humility—you are literally rewriting local physics. Concentration required. Maintaining this spell is exceptionally difficult—when taking damage, roll 2× Proficiency dice instead of normal Proficiency dice, and need half to succeed (round up) or concentration breaks. Cost: Lose 2 Resolve and 2 HD when cast. On failure, the change happens but chaotically (GM determines reality tears/overlaps/contradictions). All casters in area immediately lose 2 Resolve as the Weave rejects your hubris.

---

## Ritual Casting

Certain spells can be cast as **Rituals** (taking 10+ minutes instead of 1 action):

**Ritual Benefits:**
- No exertion burn (1s do not cost HD)
- Can be performed outside combat
- More controlled, safer casting

**Ritual Complications (on failure):**
Instead of HD/Resolve loss, roll on table:
1. Ritual disrupted, must start over from beginning
2. Attract unwanted attention (spirits, enemies, or cosmic forces notice)
3. Effect manifests incorrectly (GM determines alternate outcome)
4. Backlash: Minor environmental effect (candles blow out, temperature drops, mirrors crack)
5. Delayed: Spell works but takes effect 1d6 rounds later
6. Partial: Spell succeeds but at reduced effectiveness (GM determines penalty)

**Spells Suitable for Ritual Casting:**
- Most divination/detection spells (Read the Weave, Thread of the Accord, Detect Blasphemy)
- Utility spells (Comprehend Script, Catalogue, Speak with Beast)
- Zone/area spells (Sanctify Ground, Weave distortion effects)
- Summoning spells (Call the Wild Hunt, if given time)

GM determines which spells can be ritualized based on narrative context.

---

## Contested Spells

Some spells target unwilling creatures (Pattern Lock, charm effects, mind control, domination):

**Resolution:**
1. Caster rolls normally (Proficiency + Exertion)
2. Target rolls contest dice (varies by spell, usually Proficiency dice at threshold 5+)
3. **If caster's successes > target's:** Spell succeeds
4. **Duration:** (Success difference) rounds, or as spell specifies

**Note:** Many contested spells allow targets to retry contest at end of each round while effect persists.
