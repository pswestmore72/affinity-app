# Player's Quick Start Guide
## Creating Your First Character in 10 Minutes

*Everything you need to know to create and play a Level 1 character.*

---

## Step 1: Choose Your Class

Your class determines how tough you are and what you're good at.

| Class | Hit Die | In One Sentence |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **Combatant** | d10 | You fight. You're armored. You hit things hard and don't fall down. |
| **Weaver** | d6 | You bend reality. Fragile, but reality is your plaything. |
| **Ranger** | d8 | You survive wilderness and track anything that moves. |
| **Scholar** | d8 | You know things and use that knowledge as a weapon. *NOT INCLUDED* |
| **Sovereign** | d10 | You rely on no one. Self-sufficient, balanced, dangerous. *NOT INCLUDED* |
| **Priest** | d8 | You channel divine power to heal allies and smite enemies. *NOT INCLUDED* |
| **Shaman** | d6 | You speak to spirits and walk between worlds. *NOT INCLUDED* |

### At Level 1, You Have:

| Stat | d10 Classes | d8 Classes | d6 Classes |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Body HD | 5d10 | 5d8 | 4d6 |
| Proficiency | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Resolve | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| Defense Capacity | 1 | 1 | 1 |

**That's it.** Write down your class, your Hit Dice, and move on.

---

## Step 2: Understand Your Hit Dice

**CRITICAL: There are no hit points. You have DICE.**

```
You have 5d10 = five individual d10 dice
When you lose HD, you lose actual dice
5d10 → take damage → 4d10 → take more damage → 3d10
```

This is YOUR survival. Guard those dice.

---

## Step 3: Get Your Starting Abilities

At Level 1, each class gets:
- **One or two core abilities** (your class tells you these)
- **Basic weapon attacks** (everyone can swing a sword)
- **A class fantasy** (what makes you special)

**Don't worry about higher levels yet.** Read your Level 1 abilities. That's all you need.

---

## Step 4: Choose Equipment

### Weapons

| Type | Damage | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Light** (dagger, shortsword) | 1 HD | Quick, throwable |
| **Heavy** (longsword, greatsword) | 2 HD | Needs 2 successes to hit |
| **Ranged** (bow, crossbow) | 1-2 HD | Shoot from distance |

### Armor

| Type | Defense Dice | Who Uses It |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Light** | 2d6 | Everyone can wear |
| **Medium** | 2d8 | Most combat classes |
| **Heavy** | 2d10 | Combatants (after L2) |
| **Shield** | +1d12 | Anyone proficient |

**Defense Order:** Damage hits armor first, then your body HD.

---

## Step 5: Optional - Choose Your Virtue (Affinity)

Your Virtue is your character's core motivation. When you embody it, you earn bonus dice.

### Quick Pick (or ask your GM to skip for Session 1):

| Virtue | You Care About |
|--------|---------------|
| **Memory** | Preserving truth, honoring the past |
| **Communion** | Building community, offering shelter |
| **Guardian** | Protecting the defenseless |
| **Growth** | Healing, nurturing potential |
| **Decay** | Accepting necessary endings |
| **Consequence** | Ensuring choices have weight |
| **Flux** | Embracing change and chaos |
| **Freedom** | Breaking bonds, self-determination |
| **Obligation** | Binding others to debts and terms |
| **Suffering** | Revealing truth through pain |

**Don't overthink it.** Pick what sounds cool. You can explore this later.

---

## Step 6: What About "Ways" and "Paths"?

**You don't need these for Level 1.**

- **Ways** = Your class specialization (choose at L1, but first node comes at L2)
- **Paths** = General feats (you get your Primary Feat at L1, but can pick later)

Your GM may help you choose, or you can defer until after Session 1 when you understand your character better.

1. Roll Proficiency d6s (at L1: 1d6, or 2d6 with exertion)
2. Get a 2+ = you hit (for Basic attacks)
3. Deal base weapon damage + bonus (max +1 at L1)

### Defending
1. When hit, roll defense dice from outermost layer
2. **5+ = that die survives**, 1 damage cancelled
3. **4- = that die is destroyed**
4. At L1: You get 1 defense roll per attack

### Losing Dice
- When armor dice are gone, body HD gets hit
- At 0 Body HD, you're in serious trouble (but not dead yet)

## Ready to Play

You know enough. Go explore.

When you level up (or between sessions), read more about:
- Your class's Way options
- The Path Board for feats

*For now: roll dice, count successes, protect your Hit Dice, be heroic.*
