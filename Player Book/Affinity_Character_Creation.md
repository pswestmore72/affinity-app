# Character Creation

## Step 1: Choose Your Class

Your class determines your core Hit Dice and starting abilities.

### Available Classes

| **Sovereign** | d10 | Resource efficiency master, self-sufficient duelist |
| **Scholar** | d8 | Knowledge weaponizer, pattern reader |

## Step 2: Determine Starting Resources

### Level 1 Starting Values

- **Hit Dice:** 3 HD (of your class die type)
- **Proficiency:** 1 (half your level, rounded up)
- **Resolve:** 5 (constant for all player characters, regardless of level)
  - **At 0 Resolve:** You must make a Resolve check (1d6, need 5+) at the end of each round or collapse
  - **Note:** NPCs may have higher or lower max Resolve values

### Level Progression

| Level | Proficiency | Tough (d10) HD | Balanced (d8) HD | Fragile (d6) HD | Resolve |
|-------|-------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| 1 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 |
| 2 | 1 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 |
| 3 | 2 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 5 |
| 4 | 2 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 5 |
| 5 | 3 | 11 | 10 | 8 | 5 |
| 6 | 3 | 13 | 11 | 10 | 5 |
| 7 | 4 | 15 | 13 | 11 | 5 |
| 8 | 4 | 17 | 15 | 13 | 5 |
| 9 | 5 | 19 | 16 | 14 | 5 |
| 10 | 5 | 21 | 18 | 16 | 5 |

## Step 3: Choose Your Skills

Select **2 skills** from the Eight Skills to be **Trained** in (+1d6 bonus when applicable).

**See "The Eight Skills" section in Core Mechanics for the complete list and how skills work.**

## Step 4: Choose a Defining Affinity
*this is a heavy work in progress, this will be the main inspiration engine that drives bonuses and banes (going against affinity). These Affinity will directly tie into Classes, as well as the cosmology and powers that govern reality. I want the system to be simple but impactful, so players can remember it, and it feels useful to alter gameplay and roleplaying. This system will also replace sytems like "backstories", "origins",  "ancestry", racial augments.*

Your virtue represents your character's core motivation and grants **Affinity Dice** when you embody it.

### Light & Order Virtues
- **Memory** *(Aluneth)*: Gain 1 Affinity Dice when you preserve truth against erasure or honor the dead's true story
- **Communion** *(Ilyra)*: Gain 1 Affinity Dice when you shelter the weary or rebuild community after devastation
- **Guardian** *(Caerith)*: Gain 1 Affinity Dice when you stand watch against overwhelming odds or protect the defenseless

### Balance & Cycle Virtues
- **Growth** *(Thymera)*: Gain 1 Affinity Dice when you heal the broken or nurture life in hostile places
- **Decay** *(Darthun)*: Gain 1 Affinity Dice when you accept necessary endings or clear corruption to allow renewal
- **Consequence** *(Thalos)*: Gain 1 Affinity Dice when you ensure choices have weight or witness justice through to completion

### Shadow & Change Virtues
- **Flux** *(Iosyx)*: Gain 1 Affinity Dice when you catalyze transformation through chaos or embrace radical change
- **Freedom** *(Zarun)*: Gain 1 Affinity Dice when you break bonds or forge your own identity against expectation

### Tyranny & Corruption Virtues
- **Obligation** *(Azravael)*: Gain 1 Affinity Dice when you bind someone to favorable terms or collect on forgotten debts
- **Suffering** *(Gephorix)*: Gain 1 Affinity Dice when you reveal truth through pain or force someone to confront despair

### Affinity Dice

Affinity Dice are bonus d6s earned by embodying your chosen virtue.

**Gaining Affinity Dice:**
- When you embody your Affinity (GM judges), gain 1 Affinity Die
- Maximum: You may gain Affinity Dice up to **Proficiency times per day**
- Example: Proficiency 3 = max 3 Affinity Dice gained per day

**Storing Affinity Dice:**
- You may store up to **Level** Affinity Dice at once
- Example: Level 5 = store max 5 Affinity Dice
- Unused Affinity Dice do NOT expire (persist until spent)

**Spending Affinity Dice:**
- On any roll, you may add stored Affinity Dice as bonus dice
- **Affinity Dice count as exertion dice:**
  - They burn your HD if they roll 1s
  - They count toward your per-action exertion cap (max Proficiency per action)
- You may spend multiple Affinity Dice on one roll (respecting action cap)

**Sharing Affinity Dice:**
- As a **free action** on your turn, transfer any number of stored Affinity Dice to an ally within 30 yards
- That ally adds them to their stored pool (respecting their Level cap)
- Shared Affinity Dice follow the same spending rules
- "Our purpose is shared."

**Tracking:**
Use tokens, marks, or dice to track stored Affinity Dice between sessions.

## Step 5: Choose Starting Equipment

### Armor (Choose One)
- **No Armor** (no temp HD)
- **Light Armor** (2d6 temp HD)
- **Medium Armor** (2d8 temp HD)
- **Heavy Armor** (2d10 temp HD) — **Requires Proficiency 2+** OR **Combatant/Sovereign class**
- **Shield** (1d12 temp HD)
- **Rage** type abilities (2d12 temp HD) when roll initiative
- **Magic Armor** (2d12 temp HD)

**Note:** Heavy Armor restriction prevents fragile classes (Weavers, Shamans) from turtling at Level 1. They must invest in advancement or multiclass to access heavy protection.

### Weapons (Choose Two)

**Light Weapons** (Base Impact 1 HD)
- Dagger, shortsword, hand axe, club

**Heavy Weapons** (Base Impact 2 HD, requires both hands)
- Longsword, greatsword, battleaxe, greataxe, maul, halberd

**Precise Weapons** (Base Impact 1 HD, lower threshold by 1)
- Rapier, spear

**Ranged Weapons**
- Shortbow (Base Impact 1 HD, range 30/100)
- Longbow (Base Impact 2 HD, range 50/150, requires both hands)
- Crossbow (Base Impact 1 HD, range 40/120)
*I don't think that I want to introduce weapon special mechanics in the final game; unneeded bloat, maybe just a class fantasy of the Combatant*

## Advancement

### Gaining Levels
You level up when the DM says so (typically after significant story achievements).

When you gain a level:
1. **Increase HD pool** (see progression table)
2. **Increase Proficiency** (recalculate: half level, round up)
3. **Increase Exertion Budget** (equals your new Level)
4. **Gain class features** (odd levels: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
5. **Choose a feat** (levels 3, 6, and 9)

### Feats
Feats represent specialized training and unique talents beyond your class abilities.

**You gain feats at levels 3, 6, and 9.**

See the **Feats** section above for the complete list of available feats and their prerequisites.

Feats allow customization of character progress where class features follow predefined paths. Choose feats that complement your class or shore up weaknesses.
