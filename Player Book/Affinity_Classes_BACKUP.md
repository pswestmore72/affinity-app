# Classes

## Class Fantasy & Progression

*Every class needs defined and unique class fantasy*
*Every class needs to be able to perform all 5 action types (Basic, Advanced, Expert, Legendary, Ultimate)*
*All classes should lean into elements from the Custodial Powers and other reality shaping forces within the cosmology*

**IMPORTANT:** Classes have TWO progression systems working in parallel:

### Core Progression (Every Level)
*At every level (1-10), you gain core mechanics, abilities, or class fantasy elements that define your class.*
*These represent your fundamental growth as your class archetype—new powers, improved techniques, enhanced capabilities.*
*Level 1 starts with foundational abilities; each subsequent level builds on your core class fantasy.*

### Ways (Class-Specific Subclass Specialization)
*All classes have a **Way** system—subclass specializations that deepen your chosen fantasy.*
*You gain one Way node on **EVEN LEVELS ONLY (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)***
*Ways are organized as grids: **4 columns** × **5 rows** (rows correspond to even levels 2/4/6/8/10)*
*Adjacent nodes are connected—you can progress forward in your Way, or step sideways to adjacent nodes in related specializations. Your final progression will not be fully linear.*
*Ways shouldn't generate raw power—they augment class abilities and strengthen class fantasy.*
*Choose your Way at **Level 1**, gain your first node at **Level 2**, then progress through the grid at levels 4, 6, 8, 10.*

**Example Ways (to be developed):**
- **Combatant:** Way of the Sentinel (tank/protector), Way of the Weapon Master (offense), Way of the Tactician (support), Way of the Dreadnought (endurance)
- **Weaver:** Way of the Elementalist, Way of the Transmuter, Way of the Enchanter, Way of the Abjurer
- **Ranger:** Way of the Hunter, Way of the Beastmaster, Way of the Horizon Walker, Way of the Warden

### Paths (General Feat System)
*This is SEPARATE from Ways. See **Affinity_Path_Board.md** for the general feat system.*
*Paths are broad, non-class-specific character customization gained at: **Level 1 (Primary Feat), Level 3, Level 6, Level 9, Level 10***
*Paths allow cross-class builds: A Combatant can take Shadow Step, a Priest can take War-Trained, etc.*

### Level Progression Summary
*New **Core Abilities/Mechanics** at every level (1-10)*
*New **Way Node** on even levels only (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)*
*New **Path Feat** at select levels (1, 3, 6, 9, 10)*

---

## Combatant

*Combatant is the master of the battlefield and of armor and weaponry*
*Paths will reflect areas of the Battle/Fighting Styles/Weapon Masteries, most Combatants are tied to The Concordant Halls, but any Custodial Power from any plane can bring about Combatants*
*All Combatants can use Medium Armor and all Weaponry, have a mastery over weaponry*
*They have total understanding and advantage in battlefield tactics, layouts, environmental actions*
*They all have weapon attacks as slams, shots, strikes...*
*They all have Battle Cries/Yells to influence, bolster, fear, enrage allies and enemies... various paths augment these yells just as they do fighting styles*

**Hit Die:** d10 (Tough)
**Custodial Connection:** The Concordant Halls - Keepers of Oath and Purpose
**Role:** Battlefield Master, Oath-Bound Warrior

### Class Identity

Combatants are warriors who have bound themselves to something greater than survival. Through the recognition of the **Concordant Halls**, their oaths gain metaphysical weight—each strike carries purpose, each stand reinforces commitment. They are masters of armor, weaponry, and battlefield control, wielding not just steel but the accumulated force of sworn intent.

**The Concordant Halls do not judge what is sworn—only that commitment is real.** Paladins of Azravael, mercenaries bound by contract-oath, executioners serving the Black Reliquary, shield-bearers protecting tyrants—all walk the Halls equally if their purpose is true. Morality is for gods. The Halls recognize only **will made manifest**.

**Core Fantasy:**
You are purpose made manifest in combat. Your weapon is an extension of your oath—whatever that oath may be. The battlefield bends to those who know why they fight. You are durable, skilled, and when you speak your oath aloud, reality itself reinforces your will. Your cause may be noble or terrible, but your commitment is absolute.

**Unique Strengths:**
- **Weapon Mastery:** Proficient with all weaponry and medium/heavy armor
- **Battle Sense:** Advantage on battlefield tactics and environmental combat actions
- **Oath-Forged Resilience:** Largest HD pool (d10), natural toughness
- **War Cries:** Influence battlefield through commands that bolster allies and break enemies
- **All-Tier Access:** Combat abilities spanning Basic through Expert tiers (Legendary at higher levels)

*They have total understanding and advantage in matters of Will, Resolve, Health, Stamina, Endurance*

**Hit Die:** d8 (Balanced)
**Custodial Connection:** Any Custodial Power - Conduits of Greater Will
**Role:** Invoker, Resolve Anchor, Space Sanctifier

### Class Identity

Priests are mortal vessels who channel powers far beyond themselves. They do not wield magic through study like Weavers, nor through personal oaths like Combatants—they invoke the will of forces that dwarf mortal comprehension. Through **Power Words**, they speak reality into compliance, steadying the collapsing, sanctifying the profane, transforming loss into sacrifice with purpose.

**A Priest may serve any power.** The righteous crusader channeling Nyroth's protection, the plague priest spreading Gephorix's despair, the death-speaker carrying Aralys's mercy, the contract-enforcer empowered by Azravael's infernal law—all are Priests if they have become conduits for something greater. **The cosmos does not judge. It only asks: do you carry the signal clearly?**

**Core Fantasy:**
You are a relay point between the mortal and the infinite. When companions falter, your words hold them upright. When spaces turn hostile, your presence sanctifies them. When death comes, you decide if it's sacrifice or waste. You are not the power—you are the channel through which power flows. Whether that power builds or destroys, heals or corrupts, depends entirely on what you have sworn to carry.

**Unique Strengths:**
- **Power Words:** Direct invocations that reshape reality through greater will
- **Resolve Mastery:** Steady, restore, and manipulate Resolve for yourself and others
- **Collapse Prevention:** Delay Resolve loss, turn defeat into sacrifice
- **Space Sanctification:** Claim areas as extensions of your patron's domain
- **Balanced Combatant:** Light armor + all weapons (competent, but not specialist)
- **Limited Spellcasting:** Can prepare and cast spells (fewer than Weaver, more focused)

*"The Ranger decides where and how you suffer.", "The wild obeys the Ranger.", "The Ranger wins before the fight begins."*

**Hit Die:** d8 (Balanced)
**Custodial Connection:** The Living Accord - Keepers of Life and Death Balance
**Role:** Wilderness Master, Terrain Controller, Hunter

### Class Identity

Rangers are not merely wilderness survivors—they are those who have learned to read the natural world's code and rewrite the rules of engagement. Connected to the **Living Accord**, they understand that nature is neither kind nor cruel; it simply *is*, and mastery comes from deciding where growth ends and culling begins. They do not fight *in* the wilds—they make the wilds fight *for* them.

**The Living Accord recognizes no difference between preservation and predation.** The druid who burns the diseased grove to save the forest, the hunter who culls the herd to strengthen it, the tracker who leads prey into killing grounds, the warden who knows when mercy becomes cruelty—all are Rangers when they understand that nature's balance requires both hands: one to nurture, one to prune.

**Core Fantasy:**
You decide where the battle happens, what it costs to get there, and who suffers along the way. While others react to terrain, you weaponize it. You are not tough like a Combatant or devastating like a Weaver—you are *prepared*. The fight is half over before it begins because you chose the ground, set the terms, and your enemies are already exhausted from the journey. The wild doesn't love you. It obeys you.

**Unique Strengths:**
- **Terrain Mastery:** Manipulate environments, negate travel Resolve loss, lower wilderness Thresholds
- **Preparation Supremacy:** Win fights before they begin through positioning and resource control
- **Resolve Warfare:** You decide who suffers from environmental strain

- Usable once per long rest
- "The wild recognizes its master"

## Scholar

*Scholar are the master of knowledge, weaponizing it, letting it guide and grant aid or making others suffer by it.*
*They should control structure, understanding, and inevitability*
*Paths will reflect areas of knowledge, or identifying, of seeing hidden or obscured truths to guide allies or decimate foes, most Scholars are tied to The Curator Arcanum, but any Custodial Power from any plane can bring about Scholars*
*All Scholars can use Light Armor and all Weaponry, though no mastery like the Combatants. They can all cast some level of spells, though less than the Weaver. They can craft items, they can perform, they can understand your mind before you know what is happening*
*They have total understanding and advantage in matters of Knowledge, training, social ladders, crafting, writings... the workings and musings of the mind*
*They are not just "lite" wizards/weavers... they are not just smart... they are not pure support/skill monkeys*

**Hit Die:** d8 (Balanced)
**Custodial Connection:** The Curator Arcanum - Keepers of Knowledge and Humility
**Role:** Knowledge Weaponizer, Pattern Identifier, Inevitability Architect

### Class Identity

Scholars do not merely know things—they understand *patterns*, and patterns reveal inevitability. Connected to the **Curator Arcanum**, they see the hidden structures that govern behavior, predict outcomes before they unfold, and weaponize information itself. They are not magic users who studied—they are knowledge wielders who learned that understanding something completely is the first step to controlling it.

**The Curator Arcanum teach that knowledge without humility ends the world.** But the Curator's students interpret this differently. Some use knowledge to guide and preserve. Others use it to manipulate and control. The alchemist who poisons kings, the bard whose songs topple empires, the artificer whose creations rewrite warfare, the advisor who whispers in the tyrant's ear—all are Scholars when they understand that knowing *why* something works means you control *what* it does.

**Core Fantasy:**
You see patterns others miss. In combat, you identify weaknesses before striking. In conversation, you understand motivation before it's spoken. In creation, you build what others think impossible. You are fragile like a Weaver, but your power isn't reshaping reality—it's understanding reality so completely that you make the inevitable happen. You don't force outcomes. You architect them.

**Unique Strengths:**
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify weaknesses, predict actions, reveal hidden truths
- **Knowledge as Weapon:** Grant advantages, impose disadvantages through pure information
- **Crafting Mastery:** Create items, potions, tools that augment capabilities
- **Social Dominance:** Understand and manipulate motivation, predict behavior
- **Limited Spellcasting:** Focused magic representing applied knowledge
- **All-Tier Access:** Abilities spanning Basic through Expert tiers (Legendary at higher levels)

- **Defense Capacity:** 1 *(= Proficiency, rolls per attack)*
- **Armor Proficiency:** Light (2d6) *[External dice layer, destroyed before body]*

Weapon: Rapier

Total Defense: [1d6, 1d6] → [1d8, 1d8, 1d8, 1d8, 1d8]
               (armor)       (body)
```
*When taking damage, dice are destroyed from armor → body, one die at a time.*

**Precise Strike** (Basic, 2+)
- All weapon attacks are Basic (2+) tier
- Required successes: 1-2 depending on weapon
- When attacking a target you've studied (used Analyze on, or observed for 1 round), add +1 HD damage
- You don't fight with strength—you fight with precision guided by knowledge

**Analyze** (Advanced, 3+)
- As an action, study one creature or object you can see within 60 yards
- Required: 2 successes
- Duration: Until you analyze another target
- Choose ONE mode when analyzing:
  - **Diagnostic Mode:** Reveals full information (Current HD exact amount and max, Proficiency level, all active effects/conditions, defense die type, current Resolve, class if applicable). Grants NO mechanical benefits.
  - **Tactical Lock Mode:** Reveals NO information. Grants mechanical benefits: Allies who can hear you gain +1d6 when targeting analyzed creature (doesn't burn HD on 1s), analyzed creature has disadvantage (-1d6) on all actions targeting you, analyzed creature's defense dice reduced by 1 (minimum 0).
- **Design Note:** Split into two modes—knowledge OR exploitation, not both. Forces tactical choice: understand the enemy completely OR weaponize what you know. Prevents omniscience + battlefield supremacy at Level 1.
- Usable at will (only one analyzed target at a time)
- "Once I understand you, you've already lost"

**Polymathic Mind** (Passive)
- You automatically succeed on all Basic tier Lore checks without rolling
- Advanced tier Lore checks require 1 less success (minimum 1)

  - Understand languages, decipher codes, or read ancient texts
- This bonus die follows proficiency dice rules (doesn't burn HD on 1s)
- "Knowledge is not power. Application of knowledge is power."

**Limited Spellcasting** (Passive)
- You can learn and prepare spells, representing formulas and theories made manifest
- **Known Spells:** Proficiency × 3 (Arcane domain)
- **Prepared Spells:** Proficiency + 1 (can change during long rest)
- **Ritual Casting:** Can ritual cast any Arcane spell, even if not known
- You cannot cast Ultimate tier spells
- Your magic is theoretical knowledge applied—formulaic, not intuitive

**Level 3: Inevitable Outcome**

**Expose Weakness** (Expert, 4+)
- When you have an analyzed target, call out their critical vulnerability
- Required: 3 successes
- Range: 60 yards (you and allies who can hear you)
- Effect: Next attack against target by any ally:
  - Rolls with advantage (+2d6)
  - Target may defend normally
  - If attack succeeds, counts as 2 additional successes beyond what was rolled (increases damage scaling)
- **Design Note:** Changed from double damage + no defense to bonus successes + defense allowed. Respects core defense engine while still rewarding knowledge exploitation. Prevents 2-3 HD attacks becoming 6-8 HD boss erasers at Level 3.
- After one attack triggers this effect, target becomes immune to Expose Weakness for rest of encounter
- Usable once per short rest
- "I've identified the pattern. Now we exploit it."

**Tactical Projection** (Advanced, 3+)
- As an action, engineer a tactical advantage against one enemy
- Required: 2 successes
- Choose one enemy you can see within 60 yards
- Duration: Proficiency rounds
- Effect:
  - You and allies gain +1d6 to defense rolls against that enemy (doesn't burn HD on 1s)

- Effect:
  - Advantage Node gains +2d6 to all actions during duration (these dice burn HD on 1s normally)
  - Each time Advantage Node succeeds on an action, choose one benefit:
    - Another ally gains +1d6 to their next action this round (doesn't burn HD)
    - One enemy has disadvantage (-1d6) on their next action
    - One ally restores 1 Resolve
- **Design Note:** Reduced from +3d6 (no burn) to +2d6 (normal burn), cascade benefits reduced to +1d6/-1d6. Prevents exponential snowball while maintaining strong sustained advantage. Cascade Collapse drawback ensures meaningful risk.
- **Cascade Collapse:** If Advantage Node drops to 0 HD during effect, it ends immediately and you lose all Resolve
- Usable once per long rest
- "Inevitability through sequential advantage."

**Systemic Collapse** (Expert, 4+)
- Identify the critical failure point in an enemy, object, or effect
- Required: 4 successes
- Target: One creature, object, or ongoing magical effect within 60 yards
- Effect (choose one):

- Usable once per long rest
- "Everything has a breaking point. I found yours."

## Weaver

*Weaver is the master of the Arcane, the beings most tapped into reading and using the weave around us all*
*Paths will reflect areas of the Curator Arcanum*
*All Weavers can cast spells*
*They can cast basic spells with greater ease than other classes*
*They are the only ones capable of casting the most legendary spells (other classes have legendary abilities)*

**Hit Die:** d6 (Fragile)
**Custodial Connection:** The Curator Arcanum - Keepers of the Weave
**Role:** Reality Reader, Spell Sovereign

### Class Identity

Weavers are those rare souls who can perceive and manipulate the Weave—the fundamental fabric connecting all reality. Connected to the **Curator Arcanum**, they do not merely cast spells; they read the threads of existence and pull them to reshape what is into what could be. While physically vulnerable, their understanding of reality's underlying patterns grants them unmatched versatility in magical expression.

**The Curator Arcanum teach restraint through understanding.** But not all Weavers heed this teaching. Some pursue forbidden knowledge despite the warnings. Some serve Velkir's whispered shortcuts. Some walk the Curator's path. Some defy it. All share the same gift: the ability to read reality's code.

**Core Fantasy:**
You see the code of reality. While others stumble in darkness, you read the threads that bind existence. Every spell is an act of cosmic literacy. You are frail, but reality itself bends when you will it. Whether you use this gift with humility or hubris—that is your choice.

**Unique Strengths:**
- **Spell Supremacy:** Can cast spells of any tier (Common → Arcanist → Ultimate)
- **Effortless Basics:** Basic tier spells require 1 less exertion die (minimum 0)
- **Ultimate Authority:** ONLY Weavers can cast Ultimate (6 only) tier spells
- **Arcane Flexibility:** Swap known spells during long rests
- **All-Tier Access:** Abilities spanning Basic through Ultimate tiers

### Class Abilities

*Gained at odd levels: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9*

**Level 1: Weave Reader**

**Starting Resources:**
- **Hit Dice (Body):** 4d6 (1d6, 1d6, 1d6, 1d6) — *4 individual d6 dice* *(Fragile progression)*
- **Resolve:** 5 (1d6, 1d6, 1d6, 1d6, 1d6) — *5 individual d6 dice for checks*
- **Proficiency:** 1 *(Level 1-2)*
- **Defense Capacity:** 1 *(= Proficiency, rolls per attack)*
- **Armor Proficiency:** None *(unarmored caster)*
- **Weapon Proficiency:** Simple weapons only

**Example Level 1 Weaver (Unarmored):**
```
Body: 4d6 (1d6, 1d6, 1d6, 1d6)
Armor: 0 (no armor proficiency)
Weapon: Staff or dagger

Total Defense: [1d6, 1d6, 1d6, 1d6]
               (body only - very fragile!)

- **Known Spells:** Proficiency × 5 (can learn from ANY domain: Arcane, Divine, or Primal)
- **Prepared Spells:** 3 + Level (can be cast at moment's notice)
- **Arcane Flexibility:** Swap prepared spells during long rests
- **Ritual Casting:** Can ritual cast any spell from any domain, even if not known
- Change prepared spells during long rest
- Attempting spells beyond your capability risks HD through exertion mechanics

*A level 1 Weaver could theoretically attempt to cast Power Word Kill. With only Proficiency 1 and needing 4 successes with only 6s counting (Ultimate tier), they would need massive exertion and face near-certain HD burn from rolling 1s. The system self-regulates.*

**Weave Sight** (Basic, 2+)
- As an action, read the threads of reality
- Required: 1 success
- Range: 10 yards per success rolled
- Duration: Proficiency rounds
- You perceive:
  - All magical auras and active spells
  - Magic items and enchanted objects (glow with Weave-light)
  - Weave disturbances (recently cast spells, wild magic zones)
  - Planar boundaries and thin places between realms
- Usable at will
- "The Weave is always visible to those trained to see it"

**Thread Literacy** (Passive)
- Basic tier spells require 1 less exertion die (minimum 0)
- You can cast Basic tier spells using only Proficiency dice if you choose
- This represents your natural ease reading simple patterns in the Weave
- "The Weave's fundamental structures are obvious to me"

**Arcane Recovery** (Passive)
- During each short rest, you may swap Proficiency prepared spells
- This represents rapid Weave re-attunement
- "The Weave shifts. So do my preparations."

**Level 3: Pattern Mastery**

**Weave Unraveling** (Advanced, 3+)
- As a reaction when an enemy casts a spell within 60 yards, attempt to counterspell
- Required: 2 successes (must equal or beat enemy's original successes)
- If successful: Their spell fails and has no effect
- Range: 60 yards
- Usable Proficiency times per short rest

**Reality Distortion** (Expert, 4+)
- Manipulate local Weave patterns to create environmental effect
- Required: 3 successes
- Range: 30-yard radius centered on a point within 60 yards
- Duration: Proficiency rounds
- Choose ONE effect:
  - **Gravity Shift:** Alter gravity direction in zone (creatures fall sideways, upward, or normally). Difficult terrain for those not adapted.
  - **Friction Null:** Make all surfaces frictionless OR adhesive (your choice). Movement becomes Advanced (3+) check or fall prone/stick in place.
  - **Temperature Extreme:** Shift temperature to extreme cold or heat. Creatures take 1 HD damage per round, have disadvantage (-1d6) on actions.
  - **Light Warp:** Bend light and sound. Zone becomes heavily obscured and silent to outsiders; you see/hear normally.
  - **Time Dilation:** Slow or accelerate time in zone by 20% (affects movement speeds, duration countdown).
- Not direct damage—reality manipulation creates tactical advantage
- Usable once per short rest

**Level 5: Thread Master**

**Arcane Supremacy** (Expert, 4+)
- Briefly assert complete dominance over reality's patterns
- Required: 4 successes
- Duration: Proficiency rounds
- Gain ALL benefits (you may use each once per round):
  - **Fate Manipulation:** Reroll one die (yours, ally's, or enemy's) before result declared
  - **Efficient Weaving:** Reduce one spell's exertion minimum by 2 (minimum 0) 
  - **Time Extension:** Extend one active spell's duration by 1 round
- Usable once per long rest
- "For a brief moment, I AM the Weave"

## Shaman

*Shaman are the embodiment of the Spirit expressed... they manifest, they commune with the accords. Where Rangers embody the wilds and the tangible terrain... Shamans embody "what is beyond"*
*Life and Death, Stone and Air, Fire and Water, Mortal and spirit, Self and Affinity; Shaman communes with consequence*
*Paths will reflect areas of the communing with the spirits, with great powers, with reality and with what lies beyond reality, most Shamans are tied to The Living Accords, but any Custodial Power from any plane can bring about Shamans*
*All Shamans can use Light Armor and all Weaponry, though no mastery like the Combatants. They can all cast some level of spells, though less than the Weaver.*
*They have total understanding of the spirit, of the liminal spaces, of what is beyond and between what others perceive. They don't control the natural world, they wield it by communing with what lies beyond it.*
*They all have the ability to commune, to see beyond, to become a drop in a flowing river, to step past what others can*
*They are not just an Elemental blaster, not just another Healer, not Just "nature magic"*

**Hit Die:** d6 (Fragile)
**Custodial Connection:** The Living Accord - Walkers Between Life and Death
**Role:** Spirit Communer, Threshold Walker, Liminal Channeler

### Class Identity

Shamans do not master the physical world like Rangers—they commune with what lies *beyond* it. They walk the thresholds between life and death, self and other, stone and spirit. Connected to the **Living Accord**, they understand that reality has two faces: the tangible world others see, and the spirit realm that underlies it. Where Rangers weaponize terrain, Shamans bridge worlds. Where Priests channel greater will, Shamans *merge* with it.

**The Living Accord recognizes those who exist between.** The death-speaker who carries ancestor voices, the storm-caller who becomes the wind, the flesh-shaper who blurs the line between beast and mortal, the threshold-keeper who guards the passages between realms—all are Shamans when they learn to stand with one foot in each world. They do not command spirits. They *invite them in*.

**Core Fantasy:**
You exist between states. While others are fully here or fully there, you walk both worlds. You don't cast elemental magic—you commune with elemental spirits and they answer. You don't heal mechanically—you balance life and death in the moment. You don't transform mystically—something *else* rides you, speaks through you, acts with your hands. The price is never being fully yourself. The power is never being *only* yourself.

**Unique Strengths:**
- **Spirit Communion:** Invite spirits to manifest through you or alongside you
- **Threshold Sight:** See and navigate liminal spaces others cannot perceive
- **Duality Embodiment:** Hold contradictions—life and death, flesh and spirit, self and other
- **Guided Strikes:** Spirits direct your hand in combat (competent warrior, not master)
- **Limited Spellcasting:** Magic as conversation with spiritual forces
- **All-Tier Access:** Abilities spanning Basic through Expert tiers (Legendary at higher levels)

- **Armor Proficiency:** Light (2d6) *[External dice layer, destroyed before body]*
- **Weapon Proficiency:** All weapons
- **Prepared Spells:** 2 (Proficiency + 1)

**Example Level 1 Shaman with Gear:**
```
Body: 4d6 (1d6, 1d6, 1d6, 1d6)
Armor: 2d6 leather (1d6, 1d6)
Weapon: Spirit-touched staff

**Spirit-Guided Strike** (Basic, 2+)
- All weapon attacks are Basic (2+) tier
- Required successes: 1-2 depending on weapon

- Choose the spirit's nature:

- You have advantage (gain +1d6) on all rolls to:

- Tear open a portal between mortal and spirit realms
- Required: 4 successes

## Sovereign

*The Sovereign: "Where others draw from the cosmos, I draw from myself."*
*They are the proof that the universe's structure is not absolute. They are the crack in the metaphysical system.*
*This class masters resource efficiency—manipulating HD, Exertion, and Resolve through perfect internal control*
*Paths will reflect martial disciplines and internal philosophies - stances, forms, meditation techniques that refine their efficiency*
*All Sovereigns can use Light and Medium Armor and all Weaponry, though no mastery like the Combatants. They cannot cast spells - they need nothing external.*
*They have total understanding and advantage in matters of internal discipline, self-control, mental fortitude, resistance to external manipulation*
*Their Role: Resource efficiency expert and last-one-standing specialist. They operate at peak effectiveness longer than anyone else. When others burn bright and collapse, Sovereigns endure through perfect economy.*

**Hit Die:** d10 (Tough)
**Custodial Connection:** Any or None - Self-Sufficient Anomaly
**Role:** Resource Master, Endurance Specialist, Unbreakable Duelist

### Class Identity

Sovereigns are masters of internal economy. While others burn resources frantically, Sovereigns have perfected the art of using exactly what is needed—no more, no less. They do not reject cosmic power; they simply prove it unnecessary. Through meditation, discipline, and absolute self-knowledge, they manipulate their own thresholds, converting between resources and operating when others would collapse.

**Sovereigns can be recognized by any Custodial Power—or by none.** The duelist who never wastes a motion, the ascetic who walks for days without rest, the condemned who refuses death through pure will, the warmaster who remains calm while armies panic—all are Sovereigns when they prove that perfected self-control surpasses borrowed power.

**Core Fantasy:**
You are a closed system, perfectly efficient. Every point of HD, every die of Exertion, every point of Resolve—you know exactly where it goes and what it buys. You convert resources like an alchemist transmutes elements: Resolve becomes endurance, HD becomes damage, Exertion becomes precision. You are not flashy. You are *efficient*. And efficiency means you're still fighting when everyone else has collapsed.

**Unique Strengths:**
- **Resource Conversion:** Trade HD ↔ Resolve ↔ Exertion efficiency through active abilities
- **Perfect Economy:** Reduce costs, prevent waste, bank resources across rounds
- **Threshold Manipulation:** Operate beyond normal limits through internal adjustments
- **Collapse Resistance:** Last one standing through refusal and resource management
- **No External Dependencies:** No spells, spirits, or channeled power needed
- **Consistent Combatant:** Light/Medium armor + all weapons, unaffected by cosmic forces
- **All-Tier Access:** Abilities spanning Basic through Expert tiers (Legendary at higher levels)

### Class Abilities

*Gained at odd levels: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9*

**Level 1: Internal Economy**

**Starting Resources:**
- **Hit Dice (Body):** 5d10 (1d10, 1d10, 1d10, 1d10, 1d10) — *5 individual d10 dice*
- **Resolve:** 5 (1d6, 1d6, 1d6, 1d6, 1d6) — *5 individual d6 dice for checks*
- **Proficiency:** 1 *(Level 1-2)*
- **Defense Capacity:** 1 *(= Proficiency, rolls per attack)*
- **Armor Proficiency:** Light (2d6), Medium (3d8) *[External dice layer, destroyed before body]*

**Example Level 1 Sovereign with Gear:**
```
Body: 5d10 (1d10, 1d10, 1d10, 1d10, 1d10)
Armor: 3d8 chain shirt (1d8, 1d8, 1d8)
Weapon: Longsword

Total Defense: [1d8, 1d8, 1d8] → [1d10, 1d10, 1d10, 1d10, 1d10]

**Internal Alchemy** (Passive — Core Mechanic)
- You can convert between your internal resources using actions:
  - **Resolve → Endurance:** Spend 1 Resolve as free action to prevent next Proficiency HD loss (once per round)

  - **Efficiency Banking:** Unused Exertion budget from previous turn grants +1d6 to your first roll next turn (does not burn HD on 1s)
- This is your core mechanic—you are a resource alchemist
- **Sovereign Advantage:** Steady action requires using an action (3 HD → 1 Resolve). Your HD→Will conversion triggers AUTOMATICALLY when taking damage, costs no action, and happens at end of turn (superior efficiency)
- "Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted"

**Sovereign Discipline** (Passive)

  - Resist mental manipulation, charm, fear, domination

- Effect: Restore Proficiency HD immediately

- "I allocate resources precisely"

**Level 3: Threshold Mastery**

**Resource Cascade** (Advanced, 3+)
- When you successfully strike an enemy (any attack), you may trigger this cascade
- Required: 2 successes (rolled after your attack succeeds)

  - **If HD is below half:** Restore Proficiency HD
  - **If Resolve is below 5:** Restore 1 Resolve  
  - **If you used maximum Exertion this turn:** Next turn your Exertion budget increases by +2
- Victory feeds efficiency
- Usable Proficiency times per short rest
- **Sovereign Advantage:** Steady costs 3 HD and an action to gain 1 Resolve. You restore Resolve WHILE attacking successfully, no separate action needed (combat-integrated efficiency)
- "Every action strengthens the next"

**Deny Death** (Expert, 4+)
- When you would lose Resolve and drop to 0 Resolve, you may refuse
- Required: 3 successes (roll using Proficiency + any remaining exertion before failing the Resolve check)
- On success: You do not lose the Resolve (remain at 1 Resolve minimum)
- Can also be used when at 0 HD and about to make a Resolve check—success means you automatically pass the check
- **Restriction:** You cannot use Deny Death while Inevitable Stance is active (cannot stack immortality clauses)
- You may use this once per long rest
- "I do not permit collapse"

**Level 5: Perfect Control**

**Flawless Economy** (Expert, 4+)
- Achieve perfect resource state for 2 rounds
- Required: 3 successes
- Duration: 2 rounds (fixed, not Proficiency rounds)
- Gain ALL benefits simultaneously:
  - Your Internal Alchemy conversions no longer have "once per round" limits
  - All Exertion dice that roll 1 become 2 automatically (no waste)
  - You may take one additional action per turn (pure efficiency)
- Cost: Lose 3 Resolve when effect ends (cannot be reduced or prevented by any ability)
- **High Risk:** If reduced to 0 Resolve while Flawless Economy is active, effect ends immediately and you collapse
- **Design Note:** Short explosive burst (2 rounds flat, not scaling). Removed unlimited bonus cap (would break bounded accuracy). Extra action + perfect conversions + no waste is enough dominance without breaking math ceiling.
- Usable once per short rest
- "This is what mastery looks like—and it costs everything"

**Inevitable Stance** (Expert, 4+)
- When you are the last ally standing (all others at 0 HD or 0 Resolve within 60 yards)
- Required: 4 successes
- Duration: Until allies recover or Proficiency rounds (whichever comes first)
- You become the immovable axis:
  - Gain temporary HD equal to twice your Proficiency
  - All attacks deal +Proficiency HD damage
  - You have advantage (+2d6) on any Resolve checks
  - Enemies attacking you must roll with disadvantage (-1d6)
  - You cannot be moved, knocked prone, or displaced
- Cost: When this ends, you must make a Resolve check (you exceeded all limits)
- **Design Note:** Changed auto-succeed Resolve checks to advantage. Auto-pass kills tension—Sovereign should be extremely resilient, not invulnerable.
- Usable once per long rest
- "I am the constant. Reality can adjust."

## Initiative

At the start of any encounter (combat or social), all participants roll initiative.

**Roll:** PROFICIENCY per character

**Highest result goes first**, then descending order.

**Ties:** Reroll among tied participants.

**Turn-Based:** Each character takes their full turn in initiative order.

**Rally to Action:** When you roll initiative and are not surprised, gain 1 Resolve (maximum 5). The rush of engagement sharpens your focus.
