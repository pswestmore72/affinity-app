# Feats: The Path Board

**What steps do you take to advance yourself?**

Feats represent your journey of personal growth—not raw power, but **focus and flavor**. They augment your abilities without overshadowing your class. Each node offers a different lens through which to experience the world: combat tactics, social maneuvering, skilled precision, or resourceful adaptation.

## How the Path Board Works

**Level 1:** Choose one **Primary Feat** (your foundation—the strongest feat you'll ever take)

**Levels 3, 6, 9, 10:** Select one **Connected Node** adjacent to any feat you already possess (including diagonal connections)

### Path Board Rules

- **Start with Foundation:** At Level 1, choose one Primary Feat from the ten disciplines below. This is your strongest feat.
- **All Nodes Equal Power:** Nodes beyond your Primary are roughly equal in power regardless of when you take them—no power creep by level
- **Follow Adjacent Paths:** Each new feat must connect to one you already have (adjacent/diagonal)
- **Build Your Web:** You can branch into multiple disciplines or specialize deeply in one
- **Cross-Discipline Connections:** Many nodes bridge multiple paths (marked with →)
- **Diverse Benefits:** Each path offers combat, social, skill, downtime, and resource utilities—not just "more of what your class does"
- **Node Format:** Each feat shows its connections: `[Connected Node Names]`

### Design Philosophy

**Feats augment player fantasy, not class identity:**
- A Priest taking War-Trained doesn't become a Combatant
- A Combatant taking Silver Tongue doesn't become a social class
- These are **focuses** that let you customize how you engage with challenges
- Your class abilities remain your primary power source

### Feat Power Budget

**Each feat node grants ONE of the following:**
- **+1 die in a specific narrow circumstance** ("when defending an ally," "when using signature weapon against surprised foe")
- **Reduce required successes by 1 in a specific narrow circumstance** ("social checks to comfort grieving," "tracking in wilderness")
- **Once per scene ability** (triggered situational effect with narrow scope)
- **Minor HD recovery trigger** ("regain 1 HD when you prevent ally death," "restore 1 HD when oath is honored")
- **Social leverage trigger** ("gain reputation benefit in specific context")
- **Tactical positioning benefit** ("move without triggering reactions in specific case")

**Feats NEVER grant:**
- ❌ Permanent +1 defense die to all defense rolls
- ❌ Permanent +1 proficiency
- ❌ Increased exertion cap per turn
- ❌ Increased HD pool
- ❌ Flat damage increases
- ❌ Always-on bonuses that bypass risk

**Critical Principle: Feats change WHEN you push, not HOW STRONG pushing is.**

Your system has:
- Exertion risk (1s burn HD)
- Resolve collapse (pressure and failure)
- HD attrition (resource depletion)
- Threshold scaling (action difficulty)

Feats should work **with** these systems, creating interesting **choices about when to commit**, not making commitment safer or stronger.

**Good Feat Examples:**
- "When at 0 Resolve, first Resolve check each scene gains +1d6" (changes desperation behavior)
- "After succeeding at Expert threshold, gain +1d6 on next social check same scene" (cross-system reward)
- "When defending an ally within 5 yards, you may redirect attack to yourself as free action" (tactical choice)

**Bad Feat Examples:**
- "Always +1d6 to combat rolls" (always-on power inflation)
- "Your exertion dice don't burn HD on 1s when using axes" (bypasses core risk)
- "Gain +2 HD at each level" (modifies progression math)

### Bridge Nodes (Cross-Discipline)

Nodes marked with → connect multiple disciplines and should:
- **Reward branching** into multiple paths
- **Offer hybrid play patterns** (combat → social, skill → combat)
- **Encourage weird builds** rather than optimal stacking

**Bridge nodes should create interesting interactions between systems, not compound bonuses.**

Example Bridge:
**War-Trained → Silver Tongue**: "After succeeding in combat with Expert+ threshold, your next social interaction this scene gains +1d6 (fear, respect, or intimidation based on context)."

This rewards high-risk combat success with social leverage—it's conditional, flavorful, and cross-system.

---

### Feat Design Examples by Type

Here are concrete examples demonstrating the full range of the power budget:

**+1 Die in Specific Narrow Circumstance:**
- "When defending an ally within 5 yards, gain +1d6 to your defense roll" (conditional: protecting others)
- "When using signature weapon after spending exertion, gain +1d6 reliable die" (conditional: weapon + commitment)
- "When attacking from stealth in darkness, gain +1d6" (conditional: environment + positioning)

**Reduce Required Successes by 1:**
- "When making social checks to comfort the grieving, require 1 fewer success" (narrow circumstance)
- "When tracking prey you've wounded, require 1 fewer success" (conditional: specific situation)
- "When ambushing unaware targets, require 1 fewer success" (once per encounter)

**Once Per Scene Ability:**
- "Once per encounter, teleport 30 yards between shadows" (tactical repositioning)
- "Once per encounter, grant ally +1d6 to their next action" (support choice)
- "Once per short rest, negate being moved/knocked prone" (defensive reset)

**Minor HD Recovery Trigger:**
- "When ally drops to 0 HD, restore 1 HD to them with rallying cry" (support trigger)
- "When you successfully sneak past threat, restore 1 HD" (stealth reward)
- "When you honor your oath in dramatic moment, restore 1 HD" (roleplay reward)

**Social Leverage Trigger:**
- "After succeeding Expert+ combat check, gain +1d6 on next social interaction" (cross-system bridge)
- "When you tell a compelling story during rest, allies gain +1d6 on specific check type next encounter" (narrative power)
- "After preventing ally death, gain advantage on Influence checks with that ally for rest of session" (earned trust)

**Tactical Positioning Benefit:**
- "Drawing/stowing weapons is free action" (action economy narrative benefit)
- "When ally would drop to 0 HD within 10 yards, redirect attack to yourself" (protection choice)
- "Gain +1d6 on movement checks when moving toward threatened ally" (conditional movement boost)

Each feat should create interesting **decision points** about **when and how to engage**, not increase baseline power.

## GM Guidance: Balanced Path Board Philosophy

**Feats Are Flavor, Not Power:**
- Primary Feats are impactful but shouldn't overshadow Level 1 class abilities
- All other nodes are equal in power—a Level 10 player isn't getting stronger nodes than a Level 3 player, just more customization
- Feats create **opportunities** (social doors, skill advantages, tactical options) rather than raw power spikes

**Diverse Utility, Not Class Redundancy:**
- Every path can lead to combat, social, skill, resource, and downtime benefits
- A Combatant taking Scholar's Method doesn't become less of a warrior—they become a well-read warrior who solves problems differently
- A Priest taking Martial Focus doesn't become a fighter—they become a priest who understands warfare

**Encourage Cross-Pathing:**
- The most interesting characters walk across multiple disciplines
- Cross-connections are intentional—reward creative combinations
- Ask players: "How did you learn that? What bridges your two paths?"

**Narrative Weight:**
- When a player takes a feat, explore it in the story
- Pact-Bound should have patron interactions
- Silver Tongue should open social opportunities
- Scholar's Method should make knowledge useful

**Balance Checks:**
- If a feat grants +2d6, it's in specific circumstances or doesn't burn HD
- If a feat grants once/encounter power, it's narrative flavor not combat domination
- Primary Feats should feel roughly equivalent in impact across the board

**Level 10 Feat:**
- Final feat at Level 10 completes a 5-feat journey (L1, L3, L6, L9, L10)
- Encourages forward planning ("Where does my path lead?")
- Allows for satisfying culmination without power creep

**Forbidden/Unlocked Paths:**
- GMs may gate certain nodes based on narrative choices (betraying patron locks Pact progression)
- Virtues might naturally align or conflict with certain paths
- Discovering hidden nodes through gameplay rewards exploration
