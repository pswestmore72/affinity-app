# Items & Artifacts of Aeralon

**Treasures, Tools, and Trinkets of the Realms**

This compendium catalogs the equipment, consumables, and magical artifacts found throughout the **Reflected Realms**, **Sovereign Realms**, and **Fractured Realms**. Items follow the same tier system as creatures, ranging from mundane gear to reality-warping artifacts.

---

## Understanding Item Tiers

Items are categorized by **Rarity Tier**, which determines their power, availability, and cost:

| Tier | Description | Availability |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Common** | Mundane equipment and minor magical items | Any settlement |
| **Basic** | Useful magical items, uncommon | Cities, specialized merchants |
| **Advanced** | Powerful magical items, rare | Major cities, quest rewards |
| **Expert** | Extraordinary items, very rare | Legendary merchants, major quests |
| **Legendary** | Epic items, campaign-defining | Ancient vaults, epic quests |
| **Ultimate** | World-shaping artifacts, unique | Lost ruins, divine gifts |
| **Mythical** | Reality-warping artifacts, one-of-a-kind (require 6 only to use) | Cosmic events only |

**Note on Mythical Artifacts:** Like Ultimate-tier actions, Mythical artifacts require rolling 6 on d6 to successfully activate or use their powers. This represents the cosmic weight and reality-warping nature of these items.

## Item Philosophy in Affinity

**This system does NOT use +1/+2/+3 modifiers.**

**Your game is a risk conversion engine.** Items should reflect that philosophy.

### What Magic Items Should Do:

**1. Add OPTIONS (New Capabilities)**
- Grant new actions (teleportation, flight, summoning)
- Provide alternative approaches (bypass resistance, ignore terrain)
- Enable new tactical choices (free activations, triggered responses)

**2. Enable CONVERSION (Resource Interactions)**
- Interact with HD, Resolve, Affinity, Exertion economy
- Exchange one resource for another (spend Resolve for bonus dice, gain Exertion die on kills)
- Trigger on conditions (at low HD, when ally falls, after successful defense)

**3. Modify THRESHOLDS (Change Success Requirements)**
- Lower difficulty tiers (Expertâ†’Advanced)
- Grant bonus/penalty dice in specific contexts
- Bypass armor or resistance in defined situations
- Auto-succeed under specific conditions

**4. NOT Flat Power Creep**
- Avoid "+X damage" or "+Xd6 to all checks"
- No pure stat inflation that makes numbers bigger without adding decisions
- Items should create **moments for glory**, not passive power increases

### Weapons
- **Mundane weapons** provide a vessel for your attacksâ€”YOU determine damage through Proficiency and Exertion
- **Magical weapons** grant properties (elemental types, conditional effects, threshold changes, resource interactions)
- **Damage comes from the wielder**, not the weapon itself
- **Best weapons create opportunities** for risk and reward, not guaranteed power

### Armor
- **Armor provides defense dice** that form your outer defense layer (rolled during defense, depleted before permanent HD)
- **Different armor types use different dice:** Light (2d6), Medium (2d8), Heavy (2d10), Shield (+1d12), Exceptional (2d12), Mythical (varies)
- **Magical armor** may use better dice types, grant conditional benefits, or provide bonus defense effects
- **Best armor interacts with risk**, protecting you when you need it most

### Potions & Consumables
- Single-use items that interact with **HD, Resolve, Affinity Dice, Exertion**, and other resources
- Consumed as an action (unless otherwise noted)
- Most restore resources; some grant temporary benefits
- **Potions can have flat bonuses** (they're temporary, resource-based, and limited)

---

**Description:** Silver circlet that radiates calm authority. Favored by court advisors.

**Amulet of Silver Tongue**

**Description:** Amulet shaped like a serpent devouring its own words.

**Ring of Truth's Weight**  
**Effect:** When you present hard evidence in a social duel, reduce threshold by 1 additional step (stacks with evidence bonus). Evidence you carry cannot be stolen or destroyed.  
**Description:** Heavy iron ring inscribed with Aluneth's runes of memory.

---

### Advanced Tier (Social)

**Mask of Many Faces**  
**Effect:** Change appearance at will (illusion, does not alter voice). In social duels, once per duel declare "You don't know who I am"—opponent loses 1 Leverage and you gain it.  
**Description:** Featureless mask that shows different faces to different viewers.

**Mantle of the Sovereign**  
**Effect:** Your Composure dice are d10 (regardless of other upgrades). Assert stance deals +2 damage instead of +1. Commoners cannot initiate social attacks against you (automatic intimidation).  
**Description:** Ermine-lined cloak bearing ancient symbols of absolute authority. Said to be cut from a king's burial shroud.

**Crown of Measured Words**  
**Effect:** +2 Composure dice. Once per social duel, after seeing opponent's stance, change your declared stance (free action). You are always watching, always calculating.  
**Description:** Thin golden crown with eyes etched along its band—Aluneth's gift to diplomats.

**Tongue of the Concordant**  
**Effect:** In social duels where you invoke the Concordant Halls or oath-keeping, reduce threshold to Basic 2+. When opponent breaks an oath during duel, they automatically lose 2 Composure dice.  
**Description:** Pin shaped like balanced scales. Hums when oaths are broken nearby.

---

### Expert Tier (Social)

**Regalia of Absolute Authority**  
**Effect:** Your Composure dice are d10. You have +3 Composure dice. In social duels, you may spend 1 Resolve to automatically win a round (no roll needed). Once per long rest, issue a Command (target must succeed on Resolve check or obey one reasonable order).  
**Description:** Complete set—crown, scepter, and orb—forged for a legendary emperor. Radiates power that makes knees bend.

**The Covenant Blade**  
**Effect:** Not a weapon for combat—when drawn in social duel, all participants are bound by absolute honesty (cannot lie, Deceptive stance unavailable to all). Breaking this compulsion costs 3 Resolve. Duel winner may demand one true answer from the loser.  
**Description:** Crystal blade that shatters lies. Said to be forged from a shard of Aluneth's mirror.

**Paradox Tongue**  
**Effect:** Once per social duel, speak a logical paradox—opponent's next roll is at +2 threshold (they're momentarily confused). If you have the Scholar class, this effect triggers automatically each round you use Reason stance (can only affect each opponent once).  
**Description:** Tiny spiral carved from impossible geometry. Whispers contradictions.

---

### Legendary Tier (Social)

**Voice of the Pillar**  
**Effect:** Choose one Custodial Power when you attune. In social duels involving that Power's domain (oaths for Concordant, knowledge for Curator, etc.), you roll at Basic 2+ threshold, your Composure dice are d10, and opponent's threshold increases by 1. You speak with the weight of cosmic principle.  
**Description:** Fragment of the Mortal Weave itself, crystallized into a pendant. Each Power's version appears different.

**The Last Word**  
**Effect:** Once per long rest, when an opponent would win a social duel, speak The Last Word. The duel immediately ends in stalemate—no stakes are resolved. Both parties must withdraw. This cannot be prevented or countered. You have spoken, and nothing more can be said.  
**Description:** A single syllable carved onto a sliver of bone from something that existed before the cosmos. To speak it is to end all discourse.

## Mythical Artifacts

*Reality-warping items, campaign-defining, referenced in cosmology*

**Using Mythical Artifacts:** Like Ultimate-tier actions, activating Mythical artifact powers requires rolling **6 only** on d6 (not 5+). Each property activation requires this check unless stated otherwise. This represents the cosmic difficulty of wielding reality-warping power.

---

---

**Location:** Heart of Living Accord

**Description:** Physical shard of chaos itself, shed when Iosyx transforms reality.  
**Properties:**
- **Reality Flux:** Roll d10 when activated (Ultimate 6 only to control, automatic random effect otherwise)â€”reality-warping effect (GM table)
- **Elemental Omnibus:** Immune to all elemental damage (passive), can produce any elemental effect at will (Ultimate 6 only, requires 3 successes)
- **Transformation:** Once per day, polymorph anything into anything else (Ultimate 6 only, requires 4 successes). Permanent.

## Using Items in Your Campaign

### Awarding Magic Items

**Treasure Frequency Suggestion:**
- **Common items:** Purchased freely in settlements, 1-2 magical per 2 levels
- **Basic magical items:** 1 per 2-3 levels
- **Advanced magical items:** 1 per 3-4 levels
- **Expert magical items:** 1 per campaign arc (levels 5-7)
- **Legendary items:** 1-2 per entire campaign (major quest rewards)
- **Ultimate artifacts:** 0-1 per campaign
- **Mythical artifacts:** Campaign centerpieces, 0-1 per campaign (require 6 only to use)

### Creating Custom Items

Use this framework for new magic items:

**Step 1:** Determine tier (how powerful is it?)  
**Step 2:** Choose theme (which deity, plane, or force does it connect to?)  
**Step 3:** Define mechanical benefit (fits within tier power level?)  
**Step 4:** Add flavor (how does cosmology manifest in item?)  
**Step 5:** Consider consequences (does using it draw divine attention?)

**Power Level Guidelines:**
- **Common:** Minor convenience, +1d6 situational bonus, simple enchantments (includes mundane and minor magical)
- **Basic:** Combat utility, +2d6 to specific tasks
- **Advanced:** Significant benefits, multiple useful properties
- **Expert:** Game-changing capability, near-permanent benefits
- **Legendary:** Define character, unique campaign impact
- **Ultimate:** World-shaping, priceless artifacts
- **Mythical:** Reality-warping, divine-level power (require 6 only to activate)

### Attunement

Some items require **attunement** to use:
- Requires short rest focused on item
- Max 3 attuned items per character
- Breaking attunement requires long rest

**Items requiring attunement typically:**
- Grant permanent bonuses
- Have active abilities
- Connect to divine forces
- Are cursed or have drawbacks

### Cursed Items

Some powerful items carry **curses** or **complications**:
- Cannot unattune without Remove Curse spell
- Gradually corrupt wielder
- Draw attention of dangerous forces
- Require sacrifices to use

**Life Drinker** example: Heals wielder but slowly corrupts non-evil characters toward cruelty. Eventually transforms benevolent warriors into monsters.

## Crafting Magic Items

Characters can craft magic items with GM approval:

**Requirements:**
- Appropriate skill (Craft, Lore, or class spellcasting)
- Time (1 week per tier (Basic=1wk, Advanced=2wk, Expert=4wk, Legendary=8wk))
- Materials (half item's value in rare components)
- Skill check (tier = item tier)

**Example:**
Crafting **Flametongue** (Basic Tier):
- 3 weeks of work
- Rare materials (fire elemental essence, rare metals)
- Craft check at Advanced tier (3+, requires 2 successes)

**Failure:** Materials lost, must start over
