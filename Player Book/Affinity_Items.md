# Items & Artifacts of Aeralon

**Treasures, Tools, and Trinkets of the Realms**

This compendium catalogs the equipment, consumables, and magical artifacts found throughout the **Reflected Realms**, **Sovereign Realms**, and **Fractured Realms**. Items follow the same tier system as creatures, ranging from mundane gear to reality-warping artifacts.

---

## Understanding Item Tiers

Items are categorized by **Rarity Tier**, which determines their power, availability, and cost:

| Tier | Description | Typical Cost | Availability |
|------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Common** | Mundane equipment and minor magical items | 1-200g | Any settlement |
| **Basic** | Useful magical items, uncommon | 200-1,000g | Cities, specialized merchants |
| **Advanced** | Powerful magical items, rare | 1,000-5,000g | Major cities, quest rewards |
| **Expert** | Extraordinary items, very rare | 5,000-20,000g | Legendary merchants, major quests |
| **Legendary** | Epic items, campaign-defining | 20,000-100,000g | Ancient vaults, epic quests |
| **Ultimate** | World-shaping artifacts, unique | Priceless | Lost ruins, divine gifts |
| **Mythical** | Reality-warping artifacts, one-of-a-kind (require 6 only to use) | Beyond price | Cosmic events only |

**Note on Mythical Artifacts:** Like Ultimate-tier actions, Mythical artifacts require rolling 6 on d6 to successfully activate or use their powers. This represents the cosmic weight and reality-warping nature of these items.

## Item Philosophy in Affinity

**This system does NOT use +1/+2/+3 modifiers.**

**Your game is a risk conversion engine.** Items should reflect that philosophy.

### What Magic Items Should Do:

**1. Add OPTIONS (New Capabilities)**
- Grant new actions (teleportation, flight, summoning)
- Provide alternative approaches (bypass resistance, ignore terrain)
- Enable new tactical choices (free activations, triggered responses)

**2. Enable CONVERSION (Resource Interactions)**
- Interact with HD, Resolve, Affinity, Exertion economy
- Exchange one resource for another (spend Resolve for bonus dice, gain Exertion die on kills)
- Trigger on conditions (at low HD, when ally falls, after successful defense)

**3. Modify THRESHOLDS (Change Success Requirements)**
- Lower difficulty tiers (Expert→Advanced)
- Grant bonus/penalty dice in specific contexts
- Bypass armor or resistance in defined situations
- Auto-succeed under specific conditions

**4. NOT Flat Power Creep**
- Avoid "+X damage" or "+Xd6 to all checks"
- No pure stat inflation that makes numbers bigger without adding decisions
- Items should create **moments for glory**, not passive power increases

### Weapons
- **Mundane weapons** provide a vessel for your attacks—YOU determine damage through Proficiency and Exertion
- **Magical weapons** grant properties (elemental types, conditional effects, threshold changes, resource interactions)
- **Damage comes from the wielder**, not the weapon itself
- **Best weapons create opportunities** for risk and reward, not guaranteed power

### Armor
- **Armor provides defense dice** that form your outer defense layer (rolled during defense, depleted before permanent HD)
- **Different armor types use different dice:** Light (2d6), Medium (2d8), Heavy (2d10), Shield (+1d12), Exceptional (2d12), Mythical (varies)
- **Magical armor** may use better dice types, grant conditional benefits, or provide bonus defense effects
- **Best armor interacts with risk**, protecting you when you need it most

### Potions & Consumables
- Single-use items that interact with **HD, Resolve, Affinity Dice, Exertion**, and other resources
- Consumed as an action (unless otherwise noted)
- Most restore resources; some grant temporary benefits
- **Potions can have flat bonuses** (they're temporary, resource-based, and limited)

## Using Items in Your Campaign

### Awarding Magic Items

**Treasure Frequency Suggestion:**
- **Common items:** Purchased freely in settlements, 1-2 magical per 2 levels
- **Basic magical items:** 1 per 2-3 levels
- **Advanced magical items:** 1 per 3-4 levels
- **Expert magical items:** 1 per campaign arc (levels 5-7)
- **Legendary items:** 1-2 per entire campaign (major quest rewards)
- **Ultimate artifacts:** 0-1 per campaign
- **Mythical artifacts:** Campaign centerpieces, 0-1 per campaign (require 6 only to use)

### Creating Custom Items

Use this framework for new magic items:

**Step 1:** Determine tier (how powerful is it?)  
**Step 2:** Choose theme (which deity, plane, or force does it connect to?)  
**Step 3:** Define mechanical benefit (fits within tier power level?)  
**Step 4:** Add flavor (how does cosmology manifest in item?)  
**Step 5:** Consider consequences (does using it draw divine attention?)

**Power Level Guidelines:**
- **Common:** Minor convenience, +1d6 situational bonus, simple enchantments (includes mundane and minor magical)
- **Basic:** Combat utility, +2d6 to specific tasks
- **Advanced:** Significant benefits, multiple useful properties
- **Expert:** Game-changing capability, near-permanent benefits
- **Legendary:** Define character, unique campaign impact
- **Ultimate:** World-shaping, priceless artifacts
- **Mythical:** Reality-warping, divine-level power (require 6 only to activate)

### Attunement

Some items require **attunement** to use:
- Requires short rest focused on item
- Max 3 attuned items per character
- Breaking attunement requires long rest

**Items requiring attunement typically:**
- Grant permanent bonuses
- Have active abilities
- Connect to divine forces
- Are cursed or have drawbacks

### Cursed Items

Some powerful items carry **curses** or **complications**:
- Cannot unattune without Remove Curse spell
- Gradually corrupt wielder
- Draw attention of dangerous forces
- Require sacrifices to use

**Life Drinker** example: Heals wielder but slowly corrupts non-evil characters toward cruelty. Eventually transforms benevolent warriors into monsters.

## Crafting Magic Items

Characters can craft magic items with GM approval:

**Requirements:**
- Appropriate skill (Craft, Lore, or class spellcasting)
- Time (1 week per 1,000g value)
- Materials (half item's value in rare components)
- Skill check (tier = item tier)

**Example:**
Crafting **Flametongue** (3,000g value):
- 3 weeks of work
- 1,500g in materials (fire elemental essence, rare metals)
- Craft check at Advanced tier (3+, requires 2 successes)

**Failure:** Materials lost, must start over
