# The Council of Death
## Faction Guide for Affinity: Focal Point

*"We do not fear endings. We have already passed through them."*

---

## Faction Overview

The **Council of Death** comprises the immortal rulers of the Gloam—vampires, liches, and death knights who have embraced undeath not as curse, but as transcendence. Where the living see ending, the Council sees liberation from mortality's chains.

The Council does not serve Aralys the Veilbearer, though her Pale Shepherds tolerate their existence. They exist in the spaces between the Mourning States, feeding on grief, memory, and the unresolved. When Focal Points tear open, the Council sees opportunity: fresh souls, new territory, and most importantly—access to the Mortal Weave from which they have long been exiled.

### Playstyle

**Relentless. Resilient. Rising.**

The Council of Death rewards aggressive attrition and punishes enemies for killing your forces. Your units are difficult to destroy permanently, and every enemy death near your Cloak formations creates new soldiers.

**Faction Ability — Eternal Defense:**  
All Formations of the Council of Death cannot be auto-hit by critical strikes. They roll defense against critical damage just as they would normal damage.

**Cloak Mastery — Harvest the Fallen:**  
If any unit (friend or enemy) dies within 12 inches of a Council Cloak Formation, that Formation rolls a Will check. On success, the fallen is raised as a Minion and attached to the Cloak Formation.

**Minion Enhancement:**  
Minions attached to Council of Death units grant +1 damage to all successful hits and +1 HP to their master.

## Lore: The Hollow Marches

The Council of Death rules from the deepest regions of the Gloam—the perpetually dark realm also called the Hollow Marches. Here, beneath a dim ever-present moon, the Council maintains their fortress-crypts during periods of Hollow-tide, when grief has curdled into emptiness and even the Pale Shepherds cannot reach all who wander.

The Council is not evil in the way mortals understand evil. They do not seek suffering. They have simply **accepted** the fundamental truth of existence: everything ends. And if everything ends, why fear the ending? Why not embrace it? Why not become it?

**The Four Mourning States** wash across the Gloam like weather. When the **Vigil** dominates, the dead walk confused, believing they still live. During **Remembrance**, the departed appear as they wished to be seen. In **Release**, souls pass onward to whatever waits beyond. But during the **Hollow**—that is when the Council thrives. When mourning forgets what it mourns, when names dissolve and purpose fades, the Council harvests the untethered.

They do not oppose Aralys. They are simply **what happens when the mercy of death is refused**.

Fallen champions who rose from death not through necromancy, but through sheer refusal to accept their ending. Each Dread Knight remembers their oaths—and broke them. They now serve the Council because service is all they have left.

### Shooters

**Skeleton Archers / Vile Spitters** — *30 points*

Animated remainders given purpose: the Skeleton Archers are precise, mechanical, relentless. The Vile Spitters are corpse-beasts that hurl streams of acidic bile. Both serve the same function—ranged attrition.

## Tactical Doctrine

### Strengths

- **Eternal Defense:** Critical hits don't auto-wound—you always get defense rolls
- **Harvest the Fallen:** Cloak formations grow stronger as enemies die nearby
- **High Toughness:** Council units are hard to damage
- **Fly on many units:** Superior mobility

### Weaknesses

- Lower raw HP than some factions (offset by Toughness)
- Reliance on Minion generation for sustained fighting
- Expensive core units
- Incomplete stat profiles require GM interpretation

### Key Tactics

1. **Position Cloaks Centrally:** Your Vampires and Liches need to be near the action to harvest fallen enemies.
2. **Stack Toughness:** Combine high-Toughness units with Shield formation to become nearly unkillable.
3. **Force Attrition:** You win long fights. Trade efficiently and let Harvest replenish losses.
4. **Leverage Fly:** Half your roster flies. Use vertical positioning and terrain-ignoring movement.

## The Mourning States in Battle

The Council's warriors embody the Gloam's emotional weather:

- **Vigil units** (Wraiths, Horrors) represent denial—the dead refusing to acknowledge their ending
- **Remembrance units** (Vampires, Dread Knights) represent active memory—the dead honoring what they were
- **Release units** (Reapers) represent acceptance—death's mercy given blade
- **Hollow units** (Liches, Monstrosities) represent grief curdled into emptiness—purpose dissolved into hunger

Understanding this helps roleplay your faction: your army isn't evil. It's **unresolved**.

*"The living fear us because we remind them of what waits. We are not cruelty. We are inevitability given patience."*
