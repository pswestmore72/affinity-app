# Affinity: Focal Point
## Core Rules for Skirmish Warfare

*Where realities converge, armies clash.*

---

## Introduction

**Affinity: Focal Point** is a tabletop miniatures skirmish game set in the fractured cosmology of Aeralon. When the Infernal Schism tore reality apart, weak points formed between the Reflected Realms—places where the Weave, the Gloam, and the Verge press against each other. These **Focal Points** are contested ground where armies from across the planes clash for control of reality itself.

Command formations of warriors, monsters, and heroes. Risk your forces for power. Claim objectives before your enemy erases you from existence.

## Army Building

### Formations

Your army is organized into **Formations**—groups of units that fight together. Each Formation must be assigned a **Formation Type** that determines its battlefield role and special abilities.

#### Core Formations

Every army must include at least the minimum number of **Core Formations** (see Game Scales). Core Formations must be different types—you cannot take two Shield Formations to meet your minimum.

| Formation | Bonus |
|-----------|-------|
| **Shield** | Cannot be auto-hit by critical strikes. May roll defense against critical damage normally. |
| **Spear** | Gains +1 attack for the entire game. |
| **Hammer** | Deals +1/+1 damage on all hits. |
| **Sword** | *(Balanced—no special bonus, but no restrictions)* |

#### Specialty Formations

Beyond your Core requirements, you may take Specialty Formations:

| Formation | Role | Special Rules |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| **Cavalry** | Mounted assault | If the Formation moves then attacks, gain +2 attacks. |
| **Dagger** | Scouts and assassins | May Scout/Forward Deploy before the game begins. |
| **Cloak** | Casters and mystics | *(Varies by faction)* |
| **Siege** | War machines | Can destroy terrain. Formations moving through destroyed terrain roll Defense against 1 wound per inch. |
| **Monster** | Titanic beasts | Runs +6 inches on all movement. Units within 2 inches when the Monster moves must roll Defense against 1d3 wounds. |

### Units and Archetypes

Each unit in your army belongs to an **Archetype** that defines its role:

| Archetype | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Minions** | Cheap buffs for Heroes. Add their stats to the Hero's stats. Do not attack, defend, or make rolls independently. |
| **Quick Strikers** | Fast, fragile damage dealers. |
| **Strikers** | Balanced melee combatants. |
| **Heavy Strikers** | Armored elite melee fighters. |
| **Mystics** | Spellcasters with the Mystic keyword. |
| **Tacticians** | Elite forces with multiple capabilities. |
| **Shooters** | Ranged attackers. |
| **Heavy Shooters** | Long-range specialists. |
| **Chargers** | Light cavalry. |
| **Heavy Chargers** | Armored cavalry. |
| **Monsters** | Massive creatures. |
| **Artillery** | Mobile war machines. |
| **Siege Weapons** | Devastating but immobile engines. |

### Heroes and Leaders

**Heroes** are powerful individual units. If a unit has the **Hero** keyword:
- They gain +3 HP and +1 Toughness
- They form their own single-unit Formation (plus optional Minions)
- They serve as the Leader of their Formation

**Leaders** direct their Formations. Every Formation has a Leader:
- If the Formation contains a Hero, that Hero is the Leader
- Otherwise, an unspecified unit becomes the Leader

### Formation Health

All units in a Formation pool their Health together. The Formation's total HP equals the sum of all unit HP. The Formation remains in play until its total HP reaches 0.

---

## Turn Structure

Each round consists of two phases: the **Strike Phase** and the **Reprisal Phase**.

### Strike Phase

During the Strike Phase, players alternate activating Formations. The active Formation may take **two actions** from the following:

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Run** | Move up to Run distance |
| **Attack (Melee)** | Strike enemies within 1 inch |
| **Attack (Ranged)** | Strike enemies beyond 1 Run, within weapon range |
| **Claim Objective** | If within 1 Run of an objective and meeting Endurance requirements |
| **Contest Objective** | Challenge enemy control of an objective |

**Valid Action Combinations:**
- Run + Run (double move)
- Run + Attack (advance and strike)
- Attack + Attack (focused assault)
- Claim/Contest + any other action

### Reprisal Phase

During the Reprisal Phase, players alternate issuing **Commands** to their Formations:

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Rally** | Restore morale, recover from status effects |
| **Reform** | Reorganize unit positions within the Formation |
| **Retreat** | Mandatory full 2-Run move away from enemies |
| **Hold** | Brace for enemy assault |

Formations may also move one Run during the Reprisal Phase.

## Combat

### Making Attacks

When a Formation attacks:

1. **Declare Target:** Choose an enemy Formation within range
2. **Roll Attack Dice:** Roll your Number of Attacks using d6s
3. **Check for Hits:** Compare each die to your Attack profile (e.g., 6/4 means 6s hit, 4s critically hit)
4. **Allocate Wounds:** For each hit, deal damage equal to your Damage profile

### Attack Profiles

Attack stats are written as **X/Y** where:
- **X** = The number needed to hit (e.g., "6" means a 6 hits)
- **Y** = The number needed to critically hit (e.g., "4" means 4+ critically hits)

**Example:** Attack 6/4 means rolls of 6 are normal hits, rolls of 4-5 are critical hits.

### Damage Profiles

Damage stats are written as **X/Y** where:
- **X** = Damage dealt per normal hit
- **Y** = Damage dealt per critical hit

**Example:** Damage 3/2 means normal hits deal 3 damage, critical hits deal 2 additional damage.

### Critical Hits

When you roll a critical hit:
- The attack automatically hits (defender cannot defend unless they have Shield Formation)
- Deal critical damage in addition to normal damage

### Defense

When your Formation takes damage:

1. **Roll Defense:** Roll d6s equal to the number of wounds
2. **Check Success:** Each die meeting your Defense value (e.g., 4+) negates one wound
3. **Apply Remaining Damage:** Wounds that weren't defended reduce Formation HP

### Will Saves

Some effects require **Will** saves—tests of mental fortitude against fear, magic, or supernatural influence. Roll against your Will value (e.g., 4+) to resist.

## Keywords

### Fly

Units with **Fly** ignore terrain when moving and cannot be engaged by non-flying units unless they choose to land.

### Formation(X)

This unit comes in groups. The number in parentheses indicates the minimum number of models for a single "unit" of this type. Costs and stats are per unit.

### Mystic(X)

This unit can cast spells. The number indicates their casting power:
- **Mystic(1-2):** Minor magical abilities
- **Mystic(3-4):** Significant spellcasting
- **Mystic(5+):** Master-level magic

### Hero

This unit operates as a single-model Formation and gains +3 HP and +1 Toughness.

## Objectives

### Claiming Objectives

To claim an objective, a Formation must:
1. Be within 1 Run of the objective
2. Meet the **Endurance** requirement for the battle size
3. Spend an action to Claim

| Battle Size | Endurance Required |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Skirmish (500) | Formation HP > 0 |
| Battle (1000) | Formation HP > 20% |
| War (1500) | Formation HP > 50% |

### Contesting Objectives

If both players have Formations within range of an objective, it becomes **Contested** and neither player scores it until one side is destroyed or driven off.

---

## Victory Conditions

At the end of each round after the first, check victory conditions:

1. **Objective Control:** Score 1 VP per objective you control
2. **Enemy Destroyed:** Score 1 VP for each enemy Formation destroyed
3. **Leader Kills:** Score 2 VP for each enemy Hero destroyed

The game ends when:
- One player reaches the VP threshold (varies by scenario)
- One player has no Formations remaining
- The round limit is reached (highest VP wins)

---

## Range Reference

| Range Type | Distance |
|------------|----------|
| **Melee Range** | Within 1 inch |
| **Ranged Minimum** | Beyond 1 Run |
| **Ranged Maximum** | Weapon-specific |
| **Aura Effects** | As specified (usually 6 or 12 inches) |

---

## Quick Combat Reference

1. **Attacker rolls** Number of Attacks dice
2. **Check hits:** X hits, Y crits (from Attack X/Y)
3. **Calculate damage:** Hits × normal damage, Crits × crit damage
4. **Defender rolls:** One die per wound, Defense+ saves each
5. **Reduce HP:** Failed saves reduce Formation HP
