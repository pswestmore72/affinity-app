# Affinity: Focal Point
## Skirmish Combat in the Fractured Realms

*Power demands sacrifice. Every formation counts.*

---

## What Is Focal Point?

**Affinity: Focal Point** is a fast-paced skirmish game where small warbands clash at reality's weak points. Each player commands **3-5 formations**, not individual models. Formations move together, fight together, and break together.

**The Core Truth:** You can always push harder. But pushing hurts.

---

## What You Need

- 10-20 miniatures per player (organized into 3-5 formations)
- Six-sided dice (d6s)
- A measuring tape (inches)
- A 2' × 2' play surface
- 3 objective markers
- This rulebook

---

## Formations

Your warband is organized into **Formations**—tight groups of 2-5 models that act as a single unit. Formations move together, attack together, and share the cost of Strain.

### Coherency

Models in a formation must remain within **2 inches** of at least one other model in the same formation at all times. If coherency would be broken by a move, the formation cannot make that move.

### Formation Profiles

Each formation has six stats:

| Stat | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Move** | Inches the formation moves per Move action |
| **Attack** | Number of dice rolled when attacking |
| **Hit** | Target number to hit (e.g., 4+ means 4, 5, 6 hit) |
| **Defense** | Target number to block wounds (e.g., 5+ blocks on 5, 6) |
| **HP** | Total wounds before the formation is destroyed (pooled across all models) |
| **Resolve** | Target number for morale tests (e.g., 3+ passes on 3, 4, 5, 6) |

**Example Formation:**
> **Blade Wardens (Threshold)** — Move 5 | Attack 4 | Hit 4+ | Defense 4+ | HP 8 | Resolve 3+

### Formation Types

Every formation is assigned a type that defines its battlefield role. These four types represent how warbands focus their strength:

| Type | Bonus | Philosophy |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Threshold** | Critical hits can be blocked normally | *Where realms meet, we hold.* |
| **Shard** | +1 Attack die | *Fracture them with a hundred cuts.* |
| **Toll** | First hit each attack deals +1 damage | *The price is paid in full.* |
| **Drift** | May choose Strain benefit after declaring action, before rolling | *Between states, we find our moment.* |

### Leader Formations

One formation in your warband must be designated your **Leader Formation**. This formation:
- Contains your warband's commander
- Is worth bonus VP if destroyed
- Typically has higher HP and better Resolve

---

## Strain (The Core Mechanic)

**Strain is the heart of Focal Point.** Any formation can push beyond its limits—but it costs.

### When You Strain

Once per activation, a formation may **Strain** to gain one of the following benefits for that activation:

| Strain Effect | Benefit |
|---------------|---------|
| **Sprint** | +3 inches to Move actions this activation |
| **Fury** | +2 Attack dice |
| **Precision** | +1 to Hit (e.g., 4+ becomes 3+) |
| **Brace** | +1 to Defense until your next activation |

**Drift formations** may choose their Strain benefit AFTER declaring their action but BEFORE rolling dice—they read the battlefield, then commit.

### The Cost

When a formation Strains, it takes **1 wound that cannot be blocked.**

Remove this wound from the formation's HP pool. This represents exhaustion, broken equipment, warriors pushing past their limits.

### Strain and Resolve

**Strain damages more than bodies.** Each time a formation Strains during a round, it suffers **-1 to its Resolve test** at the end of that round.

Push too hard, and your warriors may break.

### Death by Strain

If Strain reduces a formation to 0 HP, it is destroyed. You pushed too hard.

## Building Your Warband

### Warband Composition

Each player fields **3-5 formations** with a combined **points value of 100**.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Formations | 3-5 total |
| Leader | Exactly one formation must be the Leader |
| Points | 100 total |
| Models per Formation | 2-5 |

### Model Types

Models within formations fall into three categories:

| Type | Role | Typical HP Contribution |
|------|------|------------------------|
| **Champions** | Formation leaders, commanders | 3-4 HP |
| **Elites** | Skilled warriors | 2-3 HP |
| **Troops** | Rank-and-file fighters | 1-2 HP |

The formation's total HP is the sum of all models' HP contributions.

---

## Turn Structure

Players alternate activating **one formation at a time**.

### Determining First Player

At the start of each round, both players roll a d6. Higher roll chooses who activates first. Reroll ties.

### Activation

When you activate a formation, it takes **two actions** from:

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Move** | Move the entire formation up to Move stat in inches (maintain coherency) |
| **Attack** | The entire formation strikes one enemy formation within range |
| **Claim** | Claim an objective the formation is touching |
| **Hold** | Brace for impact (+1 Defense until next activation, stacks with Strain) |

You may take the same action twice (Move + Move, Attack + Attack).

### Strain During Activation

Once per activation, you may Strain to gain a bonus. This doesn't cost an action.

### End of Round

After all formations have activated, proceed to **Resolve Phase**.

---

## Resolve Phase

At the end of each round, formations that took damage this round must test their nerve.

### When to Test

A formation tests Resolve if it:
- Lost any HP this round (from attacks OR from Strain)

### How to Test

Roll 1d6. Compare to the formation's Resolve stat.

**Modifiers:**
- -1 for each time the formation Strained this round
- -1 if the formation is below 50% HP
- -2 if the formation is below 25% HP

### Results

| Result | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Pass** | The formation holds. No effect. |
| **Fail by 1-2** | **Shaken.** -1 to Attack dice next round. |
| **Fail by 3+** | **Broken.** The formation flees and is removed from play. |

**Shaken clears** at the end of the next round.

## Combat

### Making Attacks

When a formation attacks:

1. **Check Range:** Melee attacks require at least one model within 1 inch of an enemy model. Ranged attacks require line of sight within weapon range.
2. **Roll Attack dice:** Roll d6s equal to your Attack stat (-1 if below 50% HP)
3. **Check hits:** Each die meeting your Hit value is a hit
4. **Deal wounds:** Each hit deals 1 wound (Toll: first hit deals 2, rest deal 1)

### Defending

When your formation takes wounds:

1. Roll one d6 per wound
2. Each die meeting your Defense value blocks 1 wound
3. Apply remaining wounds to the formation's HP pool

### Critical Hits

Any natural 6 on an Attack roll is a **critical hit**:
- The hit cannot be blocked (unless the defender is a Threshold formation)
- It still deals normal damage (1 wound, or 2 for Toll)

### Attrition

**Formations at or below 50% HP suffer -1 Attack die** (minimum 1).

This represents lost warriors, broken equipment, and fading momentum.

### Removing Models

When a formation's HP drops, remove models to represent casualties. Remove Troops first, then Elites, then Champions.

---

## Terrain

| Terrain | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Open** | No effect |
| **Cover** | +1 to Defense against ranged attacks |
| **Blocking** | Can't move through, blocks line of sight |
| **Difficult** | Costs 2 inches of movement per 1 inch crossed |

---

## Objectives

Three objectives are placed on the battlefield before the game.

### Claiming Objectives

To claim an objective, a formation must:
1. Have at least one model touching the objective marker
2. Spend a Claim action

You control an objective until an enemy claims it.

### Contested Objectives

If both players have formations touching an objective, it's **contested**—neither player scores it.

---

## Winning the Game

At the **end of round 4**, the game ends. Score:

| Condition | VP |
|-----------|-----|
| Control an objective | 2 VP |
| Enemy Leader formation destroyed | 3 VP |
| Each other enemy formation destroyed | 1 VP |

**Highest VP wins.** Tied? The player with more surviving HP (total across all formations) wins.
