# Affinity: Focal Point
## Quick Start Guide

*Learn the basics in 10 minutes. Wage war for hours.*

## The Core Concept

**Command formations. Claim objectives. Destroy your enemy.**

Your army is built from **Formations**—groups of units fighting together. Formations have pooled HP. When that HP hits zero, the Formation is destroyed. Claim objectives and eliminate enemy forces to win.

---

## Your First Game (500 Points)

### Setup

1. **2' × 2' play surface**
2. **Place 3 objectives** (center and two flanks)
3. **Deploy Formations** in your deployment zone (6 inches from your edge)
4. **Roll off**—winner chooses first or second activation

### Army Requirements (500 Points)

- Minimum 2 different Core Formations (Shield, Spear, Hammer, or Sword)
- Minimum 1 Hero
- Stay under 500 points total

---

## Turn Overview

Each round has two phases:

### Strike Phase (Main Action)

Players alternate activating Formations. Each Formation gets **two actions**:

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Run** | Move 3 inches |
| **Attack** | Roll dice, deal damage |
| **Claim** | Take control of an objective |

**Common Combos:**
- Run + Run = 6 inches of movement
- Run + Attack = Advance and strike
- Attack + Attack = Maximum damage

### Reprisal Phase (Commands)

Players alternate issuing commands:
- **Rally:** Recover from effects
- **Reform:** Reposition units
- **Retreat:** Full 6-inch withdrawal
- **Move:** One free 3-inch Run

## Combat in 30 Seconds

### Attacking

1. **Count your attacks** (from unit profile)
2. **Roll that many d6s**
3. **Check for hits:**
   - Attack profile shows X/Y (e.g., 6/4)
   - Rolls of X = hit
   - Rolls of Y+ = critical hit
4. **Deal damage** per your damage profile

### Defending

1. **Attacker declares wounds**
2. **Roll one d6 per wound**
3. **Defense+ saves** (e.g., 4+ means 4, 5, 6 all save)
4. **Failed saves = lost HP**

### Critical Hits

- Auto-hit (normally can't be defended)
- **Shield Formation** is the exception—they can defend crits

---

## Formation Bonuses

| Formation | Bonus |
|-----------|-------|
| **Shield** | Defend against critical hits |
| **Spear** | +1 attack all game |
| **Hammer** | +1/+1 damage all game |
| **Cavalry** | +2 attacks when moving then attacking |

---

## Winning

At the end of each round (after round 1):

- **1 VP** per objective you control
- **1 VP** per enemy Formation destroyed
- **2 VP** per enemy Hero destroyed

First to **8 VP** wins, or highest VP after 5 rounds.

## Reading Unit Profiles

```
Unit Name     Cost  Formation    Keywords
Seraphim      45    Spear,Dagger Fly, Formation(3)

Attacks  Attack   Damage   Defense  Will   HP/Tough
3        6/4      3/2      5+       4+     6/3
```

**What this means:**
- **Cost 45:** Points to add to your army
- **Formation Spear, Dagger:** Can be assigned to either
- **Fly:** Ignores terrain
- **Formation(3):** Comes in groups of 3 models
- **3 Attacks:** Roll 3d6 when attacking
- **Attack 6/4:** 6s hit, 4+ crits
- **Damage 3/2:** Normal hits deal 3, crits deal 2
- **Defense 5+:** Save wounds on 5 or 6
- **Will 4+:** Mental saves on 4+
- **HP 6, Toughness 3:** 6 health, damage reduction 3

---

## Golden Rules

1. **Formations pool HP.** Track total, not individual.
2. **Core Formations must differ.** No two Shields to meet minimums.
3. **Heroes are solo.** Only Minions can join them.
4. **Measure in inches.** Run = 3" at 500 points.
5. **Alternate activations.** You go, then they go.
