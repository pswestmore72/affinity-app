# Halls of Order
## Faction Guide for Affinity: Focal Point

*"Where the Accord's light falls, tyranny cannot stand."*

---

## Faction Overview

The **Halls of Order** represent the martial arm of the Empyreal Accord—celestial warriors bound to Nyroth Stonebound's principles of fighting, friendship, and honor. Where the Accord itself is a realm of law and sacred obligation, the Halls of Order are its sword and shield made manifest.

When Focal Points tear open across the Mortal Weave, the Halls of Order deploy to prevent tyrannical powers from claiming these reality-scars. Their enemies are many: the undead legions of the Gloam, the corrupted servitors of Gephorix, and—most dangerous of all—the contract-wraiths of Azravael's Engine.

### Playstyle

**Resilient. Righteous. Retributive.**

The Halls of Order reward players who hold the line and strike back with divine fury. Your units are tough but not cheap—every loss hurts, but every loss also triggers retribution.

**Faction Ability — Final Judgment:**  
When a Formation from the Halls of Order is destroyed, d6 lightning bolts strike all enemy units within 6 inches, dealing 1 damage per bolt on hits that are not defended.

**Leader Blessing:**  
Any unit with the Hero or Leader keyword gains **Mystic(1)**, allowing them to channel minor celestial magic.

**Minion Blessing:**  
Minions attached to Halls of Order Heroes grant +1 damage to all successful hits and +1 HP to their Hero.

## Lore: The Eternal Vigil

The Halls of Order exist within the Empyreal Accord, one of four demi-planes that compose the celestial realm. Unlike the contemplative scholars of the House of Knowledge or the joyful communities of Brightwater, the Halls of Order are forged for war.

Here, oath-lions prowl marble corridors, their manes trailing golden light. Silver serpents coil around pillars inscribed with the names of every oath ever sworn in Nyroth's name. The air itself vibrates with the weight of promises kept.

**Nyroth Stonebound** appears to his warriors as a large Dwarf—gruff, caring, and immovable. He values inner strength above all, but never strength alone. His warriors fight not to conquer, but to protect. Their wars are defensive. Their victories preserve rather than destroy.

When a Focal Point opens, the Halls of Order see it as a wound in reality that must be defended until it heals. They do not seek to exploit these convergences—they seek to ensure no one else does.
