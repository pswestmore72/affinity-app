### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Ability 1: Defensive Training**
- **Trigger/Activation:** Passive / When defending
- **Effect:** Marcus adds +1d6 to all defense rolls when wielding sword + shield. Represents decades of guard training.
- **Frequency:** Always active

**Ability 2: Guilt-Ridden Hesitation**
- **Trigger/Activation:** Passive / When near death or causing death
- **Effect:** If Marcus reduces an enemy to 0 HD, he MUST make a Resolve check (Moderate 3+) or hesitate next turn (disadvantage on all actions). If reduced below 10 HD himself, same hesitation check.
- **Frequency:** Every triggering moment
- **Notes:** **KEY WEAKNESS** — Marcus hates what he's become. This is his exploitable flaw.

**Ability 3: Rally the Watch** *(Once per combat)*
- **Trigger/Activation:** Free action when first bloodied (below 15 HD)
- **Effect:** All allied guards within 30 ft restore 1 Resolve and gain +1d6 to next attack. Marcus shouts: *"For Silverbrook! Stand firm!"*
- **Frequency:** Once per combat encounter
- **Notes:** Can rally even corrupted guards — they still respect him

---

### TRAITS & RESISTANCES

**Immunities:** None (human)

**Resistances:** Fear (veteran, seen worse) — Advantage on Resolve checks vs. intimidation

**Vulnerabilities:** 
- **Guilt-based social attacks** (especially invoking his daughter Elara or dead wife)
- **Proof of Aldric Vex's lies** (if shown evidence Vex is manipulating him)
- **Appeals to honor** (he was a good man once)

**Special Traits:**
- **Veteran Warrior:** Trained for 20 years. Competent, not cruel.
- **Reluctant Villain:** Does not WANT to fight. Will accept surrender. Prefers arrests over kills.
- **Protective Father:** If daughter Elara is in danger (real or perceived), becomes reckless (+2d6 to all actions toward threat, ignores defense)
- **Heavy Drinker:** Often slightly drunk on duty (smell of whiskey, hands shake slightly) — disadvantage on Awareness checks when ambushed

---

### TACTICS & BEHAVIOR

**Combat Strategy:**
- **Round 1:** Assess threats. Command guards to focus dangerous targets.
- **Round 2-3:** Engage with sword + shield. Use Shield Bash to control battlefield.
- **Round 4+:** If bloodied, Rally the Watch. Fights more desperately but less skillfully (guilt interfering).
- **Near Death:** Attempts to retreat or surrender. Will NOT fight to death unless daughter is threatened.

**Defensive Positioning:**
- Uses shield actively (Defensive Training always on)
- Positions near other guards (strength in numbers)
- Protects weaker guards (old instincts from being a good captain)

**Motivation:**
- **Primary:** Protect daughter Elara (blackmailed by Aldric Vex)
- **Secondary:** Maintain order in Silverbrook (twisted by corruption)
- **Hidden:** Desperately wants OUT of this situation but sees no escape

**Personality Notes:**
- Tired. So, so tired.
- Drinks to cope with guilt
- Avoids eye contact with civilians he once protected
- Snaps at guards who are TOO cruel ("We're lawmen, not thugs!")
- If alone, might confess doubt: *"This wasn't supposed to be who I am..."*

**Social Combat Vulnerability:**
Marcus can be REDEEMED through opposed Resolve checks:

**Redemption Approach: Invoke Daughter**
- Moderate (3+) Influence check
- *"Elara is safe. We found her. Vex was lying—she's with Priestess Kara right now."*
- **Success:** Marcus stops fighting immediately. Breaks down. Surrenders.
- **Failure:** Marcus doesn't believe you. "You're trying to trick me!" Attacks harder (+1d6).

**Redemption Approach: Show Vex's Crimes**
- Advanced (4+) Investigation check (must have gathered evidence first)
- Present proof Vex has been manipulating him, show other victims
- **Success:** Marcus realizes he's been played. Turns on Vex. Possible ally.
- **Failure:** Marcus rationalizes. "But Elara... I had no choice..."

**Redemption Approach: Appeal to Honor**
- Expert (4+) Influence check
- *"You were a hero once. Silverbrook loved you. You can be that man again."*
- **Success:** Marcus remembers who he was. Surrenders peacefully. "Arrest me. I'm done."
- **Failure:** Marcus recoils. "That man is dead. I killed him."

**Victory Conditions:**
- **Combat:** Reduce Marcus to 0 HD (capture or death)
- **Redemption:** Succeed on any social combat redemption check
- **Leverage:** Rescue Elara, prove to Marcus she's safe (automatic surrender)
- **Exhaustion:** Reduce Marcus's Resolve to 0 (he collapses, gives up)

**Retreat Conditions:**
- Below 5 HD + guards defeated = retreats to town hall
- Daughter threatened elsewhere = abandons combat to rush to her
- Vex directly orders retreat = follows (reluctantly)

### LOOT & REWARDS

**On Defeat (Combat):**
- **Captain's Chainmail** (Medium armor, 2d8 temp HD, engraved with Silverbrook crest)
- **Silverbrook Watch Badge** (symbol of office, tarnished)
- **Longsword** (well-maintained, +1 quality — sells for 50 gold)
- Letter from Aldric Vex (evidence, used for redemption attempts on others)
- Small locket with painting of Elara (age 6)

**On Redemption (Social Victory):**
- Marcus provides **testimony against Vex** (critical evidence)
- **Captain's Forgiveness** (Marcus declares party "pardoned" for any watch violations)
- Possible **Ally in Final Confrontation** (Marcus + 4 loyal guards fight FOR party)
- **Watch Captain's Ring** (grants +1d6 to Influence checks with Silverbrook guards)
- Access to **Town Guard Armory** (weapons, armor, healing supplies)

**Experience Award:** 
- 200 XP if defeated in combat
- 300 XP if redeemed (harder, more valuable)

### DM NOTES

**Scaling Suggestions:**
- **For Level 2 Party:** Reduce HD to 25, lower Proficiency to 1 (young captain)
- **For Level 5+ Party:** Increase HD to 40, add legendary action (Shield Bash as reaction)
- **With Guards:** Marcus is more dangerous when supported (commands amplify minion threat)

**Roleplay Tips:**
- Voice: Tired, gruff, defeated. Occasional flashes of old authority.
- Body language: Slumped shoulders. Clutches weapon out of habit, not eagerness.
- Dialogue: Short sentences. Avoids justifying actions. "Just following orders."
- Moral cracks: Stops mid-swing if opponent mentions family/honor. "I... damn it."
- **Key Phrase:** *"I'm doing what I have to. You don't understand."* (He's lying to himself)

**Environmental Factors:**
- **Town Square:** Civilians watching = Marcus fights less aggressively (doesn't want witnesses to brutality)
- **Guard Barracks:** Home turf, bonus guards reinforce, Marcus has advantage
- **Near Vex's Tavern:** Marcus is extra tense (Vex is watching), fights desperately
- **Private Confrontation:** If party catches Marcus alone + drunk, he might confess everything without fighting

**Redemption Mechanics:**
Marcus's Resolve represents his WILL TO RESIST redemption. Social combat targets this:
- Start: Resolve 3
- Each failed redemption attempt: Loses 1 Resolve (cracking)
- At 0 Resolve: Breaks down completely, confesses, surrenders
- Each successful evidence presentation: Lose 1 Resolve (doubt accumulating)

**Party can "soften" Marcus before direct redemption:**
1. Rescue Elara (show her safe) = Marcus loses 1 Resolve immediately
2. Expose Vex's other crimes = Marcus loses 1 Resolve
3. Reunite Marcus with old friend from watch = Marcus loses 1 Resolve
4. Show him citizens he's hurt = Marcus loses 1 Resolve

### MARCUS'S REDEMPTION ARC

**Defeated by Combat Only:**
- Marcus arrested, tried, imprisoned
- Elara grows up with imprisoned father (tragedy)
- Silverbrook remembers him as cautionary tale

**Redeemed by Party:**
- Marcus testifies against Vex, key to conviction
- Stripped of rank but not imprisoned (house arrest)
- Spends life making amends
- Elara forgives him
- Epilogue: Marcus becomes advocate for guards facing similar blackmail
- **Campaign Impact:** Town respects party MORE for redemption than execution

**Optimal Path:**
1. **Session 2:** Party investigates, learns about Elara
2. **Session 3:** Party finds/rescues Elara (or confirms she's already safe)
3. **Session 4:** Confrontation with Marcus, present evidence + daughter's safety
4. **Marcus surrenders immediately**
5. **Session 5:** Marcus + loyal guards fight alongside party vs. Aldric Vex

*"I was a hero once. Before I had something to lose. Now I'm just... this." — Captain Marcus Ironhand*

---

**GM Philosophy Note:**
Marcus is designed to be a **sympathetic antagonist**. Players should feel conflicted fighting him. His redemption should feel EARNED, not guaranteed. But redemption should also be POSSIBLE with effort. This NPC tests if party values mercy over efficiency.

**If party kills Marcus without attempting redemption:** Elara appears at execution/funeral, crying. Party must grapple with moral weight. Aldric Vex mocks them: *"You're no different than me."*

**If party redeems Marcus:** Elara thanks them. Marcus becomes symbol that people CAN change. Aldric Vex loses his shield, exposed.

Either path is valid. But one leaves Silverbrook scarred. The other leaves it hopeful.
