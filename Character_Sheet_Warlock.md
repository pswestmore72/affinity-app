### WARLOCK PERSONALITY

**Core Traits:**
- ✓ **Aggressively Optimistic**: "Everyone deserves a second chance!"
- ✓ **Reflexively Kind**: Hands out snacks mid-dungeon
- ✓ **Golden Retriever Energy**: Literally tail wags when happy (Dragonborn tail)
- ✓ **Mercy-First Approach**: "Did we try TALKING to the construct?"

**Bahamut's Perspective:**
*"This one interprets 'justice' as 'friendship' and 'protection' as 'everyone gets cookies.' They are effective. I do not understand how. But they are effective. The cosmos is broken."*

**Party Dynamics:**
- Tries to feed everyone constantly
- Offers healing before asked
- Convinced the evil necromancer "just needs a hug and some therapy"
- Genuinely believes redemption is always possible
- ...Somehow this WORKS

---

### COMBAT TACTICS

**Turn 1 Priority:**
1. Cast **Shield of Faith** on frontline Fighter
2. Position to support but stay out of melee
3. Ready **Power Word: Endure** for anyone who drops below half HD

**During Combat:**
- Use **Sacred Flame** on enemies (apologizes while casting)
- **Power Word: Smite** only on truly irredeemable threats (still apologizes)
- **Sanctify Space** when multiple allies are wounded
- Offers surrender terms to every enemy (has worked TWICE somehow)

**Post-Combat:**
- Immediately heals anyone wounded
- Checks if enemies are dead or just unconscious
- If unconscious: stabilizes them, offers water, asks if they're okay
- Party: "Auryx, they tried to KILL us."
- Auryx: "Yes, but are they okay NOW?"

---

### FEATS *(Levels 3, 6, 9)*

**Level 3 Feat:** *Considering "War Caster" or "Healer" (more mercy energy)*

---

### AFFINITY DICE

**Current Affinity Dice:** 0 / 2 *(Max = Level)*

**Affinity Gains Today:** 0 / 1 *(Max = Proficiency per long rest)*

**How I Gain Affinity:**
*Stand watch against overwhelming odds to protect others. Defend those who cannot defend themselves. Hold the line when retreat would be safer.*

**Mercy Bonus:** *When showing mercy to defeated enemies, GM may award extra Affinity even if quota is met, because this energy is pure and Bahamut can't argue with the results.*

---

### COMBAT REFERENCE

**Spellcasting Roll:** 1d6 (Proficiency) + up to 2d6 (Exertion) + 1d6 (Lore skill)

**Healing Output:**
- Power Word: Endure = 1 HD + possibly 1 Resolve
- With Radiant Compassion = 2 HD (if target below half)
- Healer's Kit = 1d6 HD (5 uses remaining)

**Offense:**
- Sacred Flame: 1d6 radiant damage (Basic spell, reliable)
- Power Word: Smite: 1 HD base (2 HD vs. tyranny/undead/cruelty)
- Mace: 2 HD (but would rather talk first)

---

### NOTES & BACKSTORY

**Background:**
Gold Dragonborn raised in temple of Bahamut. Expected to become stern paladin enforcing law. Instead became... this. Believes mercy is the highest form of justice. Bahamut tolerates this interpretation because, inexplicably, it works. Has redeemed: 3 bandits, 1 corrupt guard, 2 minor demons (they're in therapy now), and 1 very confused gelatinous cube.

**Current Goals:**
- Prove mercy can defeat evil (without violence if possible)
- Redeem at least ONE enemy per adventure
- Make sure everyone, including enemies, is emotionally okay
- Befriend the stone guardians in The Hollow Below ("They're just doing their job!")

**Bonds & Relationships:**
- **Bahamut** (patron) — loves them, doesn't understand them, mildly exasperated
- **Kael the Fighter** — tries to feed him constantly, appreciates his protectiveness
- **Vex the Rogue** — "They need more friends!" (Vex: "No I don't." Auryx: "Yes you do!")
- **Paladin companion** — finally someone who gets the divine calling thing!

**Character Moments:**
- First campaign: Convinced BBEG's minion to quit and open bakery. They send postcards now.
- Party nickname: "The Platinum Problem"
- Catchphrase: "Have you considered... not being evil? I have snacks!"
- Success rate: Disturbingly high

---

### ADVANCEMENT PLANS

**Level 3 Goals:**
- Unlock **Divine Intervention** (call upon Bahamut directly for big mercy moments)
- Gain Feat improving healing/support
- Add **Redemptive Aura** path node (enemies who surrender in my presence restore party Resolve)

**Long-term Build:**
- Focus on healing, support, and redemption mechanics
- Eventually unlock **Mass Endure** (heal entire party at once)
- Multiclass into Sovereign? (For even MORE resource efficiency... more mercy per turn!)
- "If I optimize mercy hard enough, maybe violence becomes obsolete!"

---

*"Everyone deserves love, understanding, and at least one good meal. Also, justice. But mostly the first three."*

**Bahamut's Sigh Count This Week:** 47
